import Screenshot from "@theme/Screenshot";

OpenID Connect (OIDC) integrates with Identity Providers (IdP) external to
QuestDB.

It is a convenient way to integrate QuestDB into your enterprise environment,
and it provides SSO (Single Sign-On) for the [Web Console](/docs/web-console/).

Microsoft Active Directory and Azure AD, for example, can be turned into an
Identity Provider.

Specific installation steps depend on the type of the provider.

:::note

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is only available in QuestDB Enterprise.

## Active Directory

See our example using
[PingFederate with Active Directory](/docs/guides/active-directory-pingfederate/).

## Architecture

Altogether, the architecture appears as such:

/>

We can break it down into core components.

### Web Console

QuestDB's interactive UI. Users must authenticate before accessing the database
via the interface.

The [Web Console](/docs/web-console/) uses PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) to secure the
authentication and authorization flow.

In OAuth2/OIDC terms, the [Web Console](/docs/web-console/) is referred to as the _client_, and it is
assigned an identifier, the _Client Id._

Each application integrates via OIDC should be given a different Client Id.

### OIDC Provider

Typically consists of a number of modules.

We are interested in two of them only.

1. The _Identity Provider_ holds user identities and user information, capable
   of authenticating users, and to issue an ID Token which uniquely identify
   them.

2. The _Authorization Server_ grants access to resources, such as a database, in
   the form of access tokens.

The OIDC Provider usually integrates with a number of applications which require
different access to a number of resources.

These clients communicate with the OIDC Provider via its endpoints.

It exposes a number of APIs, including the Authorization, Token and User Info
endpoints.

### QuestDB

The database, in OAuth2/OIDC terms the _protected resource_ or _resource
server_.

Only processes requests which contain a valid access token.

## Authentication and Authorization Flow

The OAuth2/OIDC standard defines different ways of obtaining access and ID
tokens from the OIDC Provider, referred to as the "_flow_".

The goal of this flow is to get the user, who is sitting in front of the Web
Console, authenticated.

Then, it allows QuestDB to determine the user's permissions based on user
information provided by the Identity Providers.

Specifically, the QuestDB [Web Console](/docs/web-console/) uses the
`Authorization Code Flow with PKCE` option.

It consists of ten steps...

### 1. Secret generation

First the [Web Console](/docs/web-console/) generates a cryptographically strong random secret, called
the _code verifier_.

The secret is hashed using the _SHA256 algorithm_, the result is the _code
challenge_.

After PKCE initialization the [Web Console](/docs/web-console/) requests an _authorization code_ from
the OIDC Provider.

It calls the Authorization endpoint with a few parameters, including the:

- Client Id
- `openid` and `profile` scopes
- code challenge
- method which was used to generate it from the code verifier (SHA256)

When the Authorization Server receives the request, it checks if the user has
been authenticated already:

- If the user has a valid session, it can be provided with an authorization code
  straight away, so we jump to step 4.

- If the user does not have a valid session yet, it will be redirected to the
  Identity Provider for authentication.

```bash title="Authorization code request example"
https://oidc.provider:443/as/authorization.oauth2?client_id=questdb&response_type=code&scope=openid+profile&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fquestdb.host%3A9000&code_challenge=IwZ-WuypAY3fMtvismbj1MQUe5CzMgrBa87nYcgFoLQ&code_challenge_method=S256
```

### 2. Prove identity

Next, the user must prove its identity.

This could be a username with:

- a password,
- an OTP
- facial recognition via a mobile app
- anything supported by the Identity Provider.

  src="/img/docs/guide/oidc/oidc-setup-1.webp"
  title="Prove identity"
  width={450}
/>

### 3. Scope consent

After successful authentication, the user provide consent for the requested
scopes:

- The scope `openid` is authorization for using OIDC. No ID Token is issued
  without it.

- The scope `profile` authorizes the client to access user information.

The OIDC provider can be configured to provide the consent automatically,
without presenting the user with an additional screen in the browser.

<Screenshot
  alt="Openid and profile"
  src="/img/docs/guide/oidc/oidc-setup-2.webp"
  title="Scope consent"
  width={650}
/>

### 4. Redirection

Consent is granted!

The Authorization Server redirects the user back to the [Web Console](/docs/web-console/) with the
_authorization code_:

```bash title="Authorization code response example"
https://questdb.host:9000/?code=1L344XEY5XRka1j4ySNa8bVQSLf71as9uGLEuv_A
```

### 5. Credential request

Now, the QuestDB [Web Console](/docs/web-console/) requests the ID and access tokens from the Token
endpoint of the OIDC Provider with the authorization code.

It includes the Client ID and the PKCE code verifier together with the
authorization code in the request.

The endpoint then hashes the code verifier using the method specified previously
in step 1.

The result must match the code challenge, also provided in step 1.

The matching code challenge proves that the token is requested by the client
which requested the authorization code, and it was not stolen:

```bash title="Token request example"
POST https://oidc.provider:443/as/token.oauth2 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
grant_type=authorization_code&code=1L344XEY5XRka1j4ySNa8bVQSLf71as9uGLEuv_A&client_id=questdb&&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fquestdb.host%3A9000&code_verifier=uGZh4sQffXLgRna7D-jtEAkuXzp7Lm_okZXBljzP38coAD44kEheIaz7Pdh98KxYtYLZHNiQPCczQYeF
```

### 6. Credentials received

If the PKCE check is passed, the [Web Console](/docs/web-console/) receives the ID and access tokens.

There is also a third token in the response too, the refresh token.

The refresh token is used by the [Web Console](/docs/web-console/) to refresh the access token before
it expires.

Without the refresh token mechanism, the user would be forced to re-authenticate
when the access token expires.

The validity of the tokens are configurable inside the OIDC Provider.

```json title="Token response example"
{
  "access_token": "gslpJtzmmi6RwaPSx0dYGD4tEkom",
  "refresh_token": "FUuAAqMp6LSTKmkUd5uZuodhiE4Kr6M7Eyv.eg83ge",
  "id_token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6I...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 300 // In seconds, thus 5 minutes
}
```

### 7. Database access

With the tokens, the [Web Console](/docs/web-console/) can interact with the database.

The access token is in the header of every request sent to QuestDB.

Worried about the token? It is rather opaque and does not contain user details.

To carry out permission checks, the database has to know more about the user.
For this, QuestDB has a User Info Cache.

If it finds a valid entry with the access token in the cache, steps 8 and 9 are
skipped.

```bash title="Query request example"
https://questdb.host:9999/exec?query=select%20current_user()
Authorization: Bearer gslpJtzmmi6RwaPSx0dYGD4tEkom
```

### 8. Find user information

No user information in the cache, or stale information?

QuestDB uses the access token to request user information from the OIDC
Provider's User Info endpoint.

This call also serves as token validation, because if the token is not real or
has been expired, the User Info endpoint replies with an error.

```bash title="User info request example"
https://oidc.provider:443/idp/userinfo.openid
Authorization: Bearer gslpJtzmmi6RwaPSx0dYGD4tEkom
```

### 9. Receive user information

If the access token is valid, QuestDB receives the required user information
from the endpoint, and it will update its cache.

The cache improves performance, as the database does not have to turn to the
OIDC Provider on every single request.

Cache expiry is configurable in QuestDB.

```json title="User info response example"
{
  "sub": "externalUser",
  "name": "External User",
  "groups": ["externalGroup1", "externalGroup2"]
}
```

### 10. Permission check

With the help of the user information QuestDB can carry out permission checks

If the permission check is successful, the database will processes the request,
and then sends the results back.

```json title="Query response example"
{
  "query": "select current_user()",
  "columns": [
    {
      "name": "current_user",
      "type": "STRING"
    }
  ],
  "dataset": [["External User"]],
  "count": 1,
  "timestamp": -1
}
```

## User permissions

As mentioned earlier, QuestDB requires user information to be able to construct
the user's access list.

As a reminder, the access list is the list of permissions that determines what
the user can and cannot do.

QuestDB itself does not store external users, nor their passwords or any other
authentication related detail.

External users and their authentication methods are managed by the Identity
Provider.

Since external users are not managed by QuestDB, permissions cannot be granted
to them directly.

Instead the database expects a list of groups, called the _groups claim_ to be
present in the user information.

These external group names are then mapped to QuestDB's own groups.

The access list of the external user consists of the permissions granted to
those groups:

<Screenshot
  alt="OpenID setup."
  src="/img/docs/guide/oidc/oidc-setup-3.webp"
  title="User permissions"
  width={550}
/>

### Mapping user permissions

The mappings between external and QuestDB groups are managed with the following
SQL commands:

```questdb-sql title="Create a group which is mapped to an external group"
CREATE GROUP groupName WITH EXTERNAL ALIAS externalGroupName;
```

```questdb-sql title="Map and external group to an already existing QuestDB group"
ALTER GROUP groupName WITH EXTERNAL ALIAS externalGroupName;
```

```questdb-sql title="Remove a mapping"
ALTER GROUP groupName DROP EXTERNAL ALIAS externalGroupName;
```

QuestDB works the list of external groups out from the User Info response
message.

If we take the example used earlier, we will see that the message contains a
claim called `groups`. This name is configurable in QuestDB.

If the groups claim is missing or it is an empty list, the user cannot access
the database.

Although the user is authenticated, they have no permissions at all.

The user has to have at least the `HTTP` permission to be able to successfully
login via the [Web Console](/docs/web-console/).

```json title=""User info response example"
{
  "sub": "externalUser",
  "name": "External User",
  "groups": ["externalGroup1", "externalGroup2"]
}
```

Any change made to the user's group membership in the Identity Provider, QuestDB
will adjust the user's access list.

:::note

This might not be immediate because of the User Info Cache.

QuestDB will use the cached information until it becomes stale, and gets
updated.

:::

The same stands for changes made to the user's status within the Identity
Provider.

For example, a disabled user will not be kicked out of QuestDB immediately.

The `acl.oidc.cache.ttl` config option drives how often user information should
be synchronized with the Identity Providers.

It should be set accordingly to your organization's policies.

Other parts of the user information, such as the `sub` and the `name` also used
by QuestDB.

They could be displayed in the [Web Console](/docs/web-console/), or appear in the logs, for example.

  "Dive into QuestDB using the Rust ingestion client for high-performance,

import { ILPClientsTable } from "@theme/ILPClientsTable"

QuestDB offers a Rust client designed for high-performance data ingestion. These
are some of the highlights:

- **Creates tables automatically**: no need to define your schema up-front.
- **Concurrent schema changes**: seamlessly handle multiple data streams that
  modify the table schema on the fly
- **Optimized batching**: buffer the data and send many rows in one go.
- **Health checks and feedback**: built-in health monitoring ensures the health
  of your system.

<ILPClientsTable language="Rust" />

## Requirements

- Requires Rust 1.40 or later.
- Assumes your QuestDB server is already running. If you don't have a QuestDB
  server yet, refer to [the general quick start](/docs/quick-start/).

## Add the client crate to your project

Add the QuestDB client to your project using the command line:

```bash
cargo add questdb-rs
```

## Authentication

This is how you'd set up the client to authenticate using the HTTP Basic
authentication:

```rust
let mut sender = Sender::from_conf(
    "https::addr=localhost:9000;username=admin;password=quest;"
)?;
```

You can also pass the connection configuration via the `QDB_CLIENT_CONF`
environment variable:

```bash
export QDB_CLIENT_CONF="http::addr=localhost:9000;username=admin;password=quest;"
```

Then you use it like this:

```rust
let mut sender = Sender::from_env()?;
```

When using QuestDB Enterprise, authentication can also be done via REST token.
Please check the [RBAC docs](/docs/operations/rbac/#authentication) for more
info.

## Basic insert

Basic insertion (no-auth):

```rust
use questdb::{
    Result,
    ingress::{
        Sender,
        Buffer,
        TimestampNanos}};

fn main() -> Result<()> {
   let mut sender = Sender::from_conf("http::addr=localhost:9000;")?;
   let mut buffer = Buffer::new();
   buffer
       .table("trades")?
       .symbol("symbol", "ETH-USD")?
       .symbol("side", "sell")?
       .column_f64("price", 2615.54)?
       .column_f64("amount", 0.00044)?
       .at(TimestampNanos::now())?;
   sender.flush(&mut buffer)?;
   Ok(())
}
```

These are the main steps it takes:

- Use `Sender::from_conf()` to get the `sender` object
- Populate a `Buffer` with one or more rows of data
- Send the buffer using `sender.flush()`(`Sender::flush`)

In this case, the designated timestamp will be the one at execution time.

Let's see now an example with timestamps using Chrono, custom timeout, and basic
auth.

You need to enable the `chrono_timestamp` feature to the QuestDB crate and add
the Chrono crate.

```bash
cargo add questdb-rs --features chrono_timestamp
cargo add chrono
```

```rust
use questdb::{
    Result,
    ingress::{
        Sender,
        Buffer,
        TimestampNanos
    },
};
use chrono::Utc;

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let mut sender = Sender::from_conf(
      "http::addr=localhost:9000;username=admin;password=quest;retry_timeout=20000;"
      )?;
    let mut buffer = Buffer::new();
    let current_datetime = Utc::now();

    buffer
        .table("trades")?
        .symbol("symbol", "ETH-USD")?
        .symbol("side", "sell")?
        .column_f64("price", 2615.54)?
        .column_f64("amount", 0.00044)?
        .at(TimestampNanos::from_datetime(current_datetime)?)?;

    sender.flush(&mut buffer)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

Using the current timestamp hinder the ability to deduplicate rows which is
[important for exactly-once processing](/docs/reference/api/ilp/overview/#exactly-once-delivery-vs-at-least-once-delivery).

## Configuration options

The easiest way to configure the line sender is the configuration string. The
general structure is:

```plain
<transport>::addr=host:port;param1=val1;param2=val2;...
```

`transport` can be `http`, `https`, `tcp`, or `tcps`. Go to the client's
[crate documentation](https://docs.rs/questdb-rs/latest/questdb/ingress) for the
full details on configuration.

Alternatively, for breakdown of available params, see the
[Configuration string](/docs/configuration-string/) page.

## Don't forget to flush

The sender and buffer objects are entirely decoupled. This means that the sender
won't get access to the data in the buffer until you explicitly call
`sender.flush(&mut buffer)` or a variant. This may lead to a pitfall where you
drop a buffer that still has some data in it, resulting in permanent data loss.

Unlike other official QuestDB clients, the rust client does not supports
auto-flushing via configuration.

A common technique is to flush periodically on a timer and/or once the buffer
exceeds a certain size. You can check the buffer's size by calling
`buffer.len()`.

The default `flush()` method clears the buffer after sending its data. If you
want to preserve its contents (for example, to send the same data to multiple
QuestDB instances), call `sender.flush_and_keep(&mut buffer)` instead.

## Transactional flush

As described at the
[ILP overview](/docs/reference/api/ilp/overview#http-transaction-semantics), the
HTTP transport has some support for transactions.

In order to ensure in advance that a flush will not affect more than one table,
call `sender.flush_and_keep_with_flags(&mut buffer, true)`. This call will
refuse to flush a buffer if the flush wouldn't be data-transactional.

## Error handling

The two supported transport modes, HTTP and TCP, handle errors very differently.
In a nutshell, HTTP is much better at error handling.

### HTTP

HTTP distinguishes between recoverable and non-recoverable errors. For
recoverable ones, it enters a retry loop with exponential backoff, and reports
the error to the caller only after it has exhausted the retry time budget
(configuration parameter: `retry_timeout`).

`sender.flush()` and variant methods communicate the error in the `Result`
return value. The category of the error is signalled through the `ErrorCode`
enum, and it's accompanied with an error message.

After the sender has signalled an error, it remains usable. You can handle the
error as appropriate and continue using it.

### TCP

TCP doesn't report errors at all to the sender; instead, the server quietly
disconnects and you'll have to inspect the server logs to get more information
on the reason. When this has happened, the sender transitions into an error
state, and it is permanently unusable. You must drop it and create a new sender.
You can inspect the sender's error state by calling `sender.must_close()`.

For more details about the HTTP and TCP transports, please refer to the
[ILP overview](/docs/reference/api/ilp/overview#transport-selection).

## Crate features

The QuestDB client crate supports some optional features, mostly related to
additional library dependencies.

### Default-enabled features

- `tls-webpki-certs`: supports using the `webpki-roots` crate for TLS
  certificate verification.

### Optional features

These features are opt-in:

- `ilp-over-http`: Enables ILP/HTTP support using the `ureq` crate.
- `chrono_timestamp`: Allows specifying timestamps as `chrono::Datetime`
  objects.
- `tls-native-certs`: Supports validating TLS certificates against the OS's
  certificates store.
- `insecure-skip-verify`: Allows skipping server certificate validation in TLS
  (this compromises security).

## Next steps

Please refer to the [ILP overview](/docs/reference/api/ilp/overview) for details
about transactions, error control, delivery guarantees, health check, or table
and column auto-creation.

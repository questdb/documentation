QuestDB implements the PostgreSQL wire protocol (PGWire) to allow clients to
connect to QuestDB using the PostgreSQL client libraries. This is a great way
to get started with QuestDB, as it allows you to use existing PostgreSQL
clients and libraries to connect to QuestDB. The PGWire protocol is a
standardized protocol that allows clients to communicate with PostgreSQL
servers.

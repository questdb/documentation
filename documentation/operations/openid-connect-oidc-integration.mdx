import Screenshot from "@theme/Screenshot";

OpenID Connect (OIDC) integrates with Identity Providers (IdP) external to
QuestDB.

It is a convenient way to integrate QuestDB into your enterprise environment,
and it provides SSO (Single Sign-On) for the [Web Console](/docs/web-console/).

Microsoft Active Directory and Azure AD, for example, can be turned into an
Identity Provider.

Specific installation steps depend on the type of the provider.

:::note

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is only available in QuestDB Enterprise.

:::

## Architecture overview

Altogether, the architecture appears as such:

<Screenshot
  alt="Overall architecture"
  src="images/docs/guide/oidc/oidc-architecture.webp"
  title="Architecture diagram"
  width={750}
/>

We can break it down into core components.

### Web Console

QuestDB's interactive UI. Users must authenticate before accessing the database
via the interface.

The [Web Console](/docs/web-console/) uses PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) to
secure the authentication and authorization flow.

In OAuth2/OIDC terms, the [Web Console](/docs/web-console/) is referred to as
the _client_, and it is assigned an identifier: the **Client Id**.

Each application which integrates via OIDC should be given a different **Client
Id**.

### OIDC Provider

Typically consists of a number of modules.

We are interested in two of them only.

1. The _Identity Provider_ holds user identities and user information, capable
   of authenticating users, and to issue an ID Token which uniquely identify
   them.

2. The _Authorization Server_ grants access to resources, such as a database, in
   the form of access tokens.

The OIDC Provider usually integrates with a number of applications which require
different access to a number of resources.

These clients communicate with the OIDC Provider via its endpoints.

It exposes a number of APIs, including the Authorization, Token and User Info
endpoints.

### QuestDB

The database, in OAuth2/OIDC terms the _protected resource_ or _resource
server_.

Only processes requests which contain a valid access token.

## Authentication and Authorization Flow

The OAuth2/OIDC standard defines different ways of obtaining access and ID
tokens from the OIDC Provider, referred to as the "_flow_".

The goal of this flow is to get the user, who is sitting in front of the Web
Console, authenticated.

Then, it allows QuestDB to determine the user's permissions based on user
information provided by the Identity Providers.

Specifically, the QuestDB [Web Console](/docs/web-console/) uses the
`Authorization Code Flow with PKCE` option.

It consists of ten steps...

### 1. Secret generation

First the [Web Console](/docs/web-console/) generates a cryptographically strong
random secret called the _code verifier_.

The secret is hashed using the _SHA256 algorithm_. The result is the _code
challenge_.

After PKCE initialization the [Web Console](/docs/web-console/) requests an
_authorization code_ from the OIDC Provider.

It calls the Authorization endpoint with a few parameters, including the:

- **Client Id**
- requested scopes (the list of scopes are configurable, default is `openid`
  only)
- code challenge
- algorithm used to generate the code challenge from the code verifier (SHA256)

When the Authorization Server receives the request, it checks if the user has
been authenticated already:

- If the user has a valid session, it can be provided with an authorization code
  straight away, so we jump to step 4.

- If the user does not have a valid session yet, it will be redirected to the
  Identity Provider for authentication.

```bash title="Authorization code request example"
https://oidc.provider:443/as/authorization.oauth2?client_id=questdb&response_type=code&scope=openid&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fquestdb.host%3A9000&code_challenge=IwZ-WuypAY3fMtvismbj1MQUe5CzMgrBa87nYcgFoLQ&code_challenge_method=S256
```

### 2. Prove identity

Next, the user must prove its identity.

This could be a username with:

- a password,
- an OTP
- facial recognition via a mobile app
- or anything else supported by the Identity Provider.

<Screenshot
  alt="Creating profiles"
  src="images/docs/guide/oidc/oidc-setup-1.webp"
  title="Prove identity"
  width={450}
/>

### 3. Scope consent

After successful authentication, the user provides consent for the requested
scopes.

The list of scopes are configurable.

By default the Web Console requests only the `openid` scope which is mandatory
for OIDC.

No ID Token is issued without it.

The OIDC provider can be configured to provide the consent automatically,
without presenting the user with an additional screen in the browser.

<Screenshot
  alt="Openid and profile"
  src="images/docs/guide/oidc/oidc-setup-2.webp"
  title="Scope consent"
  width={650}
/>

### 4. Redirection

Consent is granted!

The Authorization Server redirects the user back to the
[Web Console](/docs/web-console/) with the _authorization code_:

```bash title="Authorization code response example"
https://questdb.host:9000/?code=1L344XEY5XRka1j4ySNa8bVQSLf71as9uGLEuv_A
```

### 5. Credential request

Now, the QuestDB [Web Console](/docs/web-console/) requests the ID and access
tokens from the Token endpoint of the OIDC Provider with the authorization code.

It includes the Client ID and the PKCE code verifier together with the
authorization code in the request.

The endpoint then hashes the code verifier using the method specified previously
in step 1.

The result must match the code challenge, also provided in step 1.

The matching code challenge proves that the token is requested by the client
which requested the authorization code, and it was not stolen:

```bash title="Token request example"
POST https://oidc.provider:443/as/token.oauth2 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
grant_type=authorization_code&code=1L344XEY5XRka1j4ySNa8bVQSLf71as9uGLEuv_A&client_id=questdb&&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fquestdb.host%3A9000&code_verifier=uGZh4sQffXLgRna7D-jtEAkuXzp7Lm_okZXBljzP38coAD44kEheIaz7Pdh98KxYtYLZHNiQPCczQYeF
```

### 6. Credentials received

If the PKCE check is passed, the Web Console receives the ID and access tokens.

There is a third token in the response too, the refresh token.

The refresh token is used by the Web Console to refresh the access token before
it expires.

Without the refresh token mechanism, the user would be forced to re-authenticate
when the access token expires.

The validity of the tokens are configurable inside the OIDC Provider.

```json title="Token response example"
{
  "access_token": "gslpJtzmmi6RwaPSx0dYGD4tEkom",
  "refresh_token": "FUuAAqMp6LSTKmkUd5uZuodhiE4Kr6M7Eyv.eg83ge",
  "id_token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6I...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 300 // In seconds, thus 5 minutes
}
```

### 7. Database access

With the tokens, the Web Console can interact with the database.

The access token is in the header of every request sent to QuestDB.

> **Worried about exposing the token?** It is rather opaque and does not contain
> user details.

To carry out permission checks, the database has to know more about the user.

For this, QuestDB has a User Info Cache.

If it finds a valid entry with the access token in the cache, steps 8 and 9 are
skipped:

```bash title="Query request example"
https://questdb.host:9999/exec?query=select%20current_user()
Authorization: Bearer gslpJtzmmi6RwaPSx0dYGD4tEkom
```

### 8. Find user information

No user information in the cache, or stale information?

QuestDB uses the access token to request user information from the OIDC
Provider's User Info endpoint.

This call also serves as token validation.

If the token is not real or has been expired, the User Info endpoint replies
with an error:

```bash title="User info request example"
https://oidc.provider:443/idp/userinfo.openid
Authorization: Bearer gslpJtzmmi6RwaPSx0dYGD4tEkom
```

### 9. Receive user information

If the access token is valid, QuestDB receives the required user information
from the endpoint, then updates its cache.

The cache improves performance, as QuestDB does not have to turn to the OIDC
Provider on every single request.

Do note that cache expiry is configurable:

```json title="User info response example with Active Directory groups"
{
  "sub": "externalUser",
  "name": "External User",
  "groups": [
    "CN=TestGroup1,OU=DC Users,DC=ad,DC=quest,DC=dev",
    "CN=TestGroup2,OU=DC Users,DC=ad,DC=quest,DC=dev"
  ]
}
```

### 10. Permission check

With the help of the user information, QuestDB can carry out
[permission checks](#user-permissions).

If the permission check is successful, the database will process the request,
and then sends the results back:

```json title="Query response example"
{
  "query": "select current_user()",
  "columns": [
    {
      "name": "current_user",
      "type": "STRING"
    }
  ],
  "dataset": [["External User"]],
  "count": 1,
  "timestamp": -1
}
```

## Interactive clients

Any interactive client - a UI, Jupyter notebook, CLI - can integrate with an
OIDC provider. However, the level of support will vary between these tools.

Interactive clients usually fall into one of the following categories:

- Browser-based clients with support for HTTP redirects; this includes the Web
  Console or any javascript UI
- Applications running in a browser without support for redirects, such as
  Jupyter notebooks
- Non-browser based clients, usually some kind of command line interface (CLI)
  or a standalone application, such as Microsoft Access

### Browser-based clients

If the tool is browser based and can handle HTTP redirects, it can implement two
possible flows to request an access token.:

1. [Authorization Code](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth)
   flow **(Recommended, more secure)**

2. [Implicit](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ImplicitFlowAuth)
   flow

The Web Console implements the
[Authorization Code Flow with PKCE](https://oauth.net/2/pkce), which is a
special version of the Authorization Code flow designed for mobile apps and
single page applications.

Regardless of which flow is used by the web or mobile application, the requested
access token can be used for authentication and authorization when communicating
with QuestDB as explained in the [above 7th step](#7-database-access).

### Jupyter notebook

JupyterHub can integrate with OAuth2 providers using OAuthenticator, as
described in its
[documentation](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/explanation/oauth.html).
The OAuthenticator documentation also contains
[examples](https://oauthenticator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/provider-specific-setup/index.html)
using different identity providers.

If Jupyter notebooks are used without JupyterHub, one option for OAuth2
integration is to use the
[Resource Owner Password Credentials](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/password)
flow. It is likely that to enable this flow in your OAuth2 provider will require
additional setup. The Resource Owner Password Credentials flow is legacy, and
should be used as a last resort.

We can use the code below to acquire an access token in our notebook:

```python
from urllib import request, parse
import json

url = "https://oidc.provider:443/as/token.oauth2"
data = parse.urlencode( {
    "grant_type": "password",
    "username": "testuser",
    "password": "testpwd",
    "scope": "openid",
    "client_id": "testclient"
} ).encode()
req = request.Request(url=url, data=data)
req.add_header("Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded")
with request.urlopen(req) as f:
    body = f.read().decode(f.headers.get_content_charset())
    resp = json.loads(body)
    access_token = resp["access_token"]
```

This token can be used to authenticate with QuestDB:

```python
query = parse.urlencode({
    "query": "select current_user()"
})
req = request.Request(f"http://localhost:9000/exec?{query}")
req.add_header("Authorization", f"Bearer {access_token}")
with request.urlopen(req) as f:
    body = f.read().decode(f.headers.get_content_charset())
    resp = json.loads(body)
    print(resp)
```

#### Externalizing credentials

The above example saves the user's credentials into the notebook, potentially
exposing them to others. One way to improve this is to use environment variables
or files to externalize the username and password.

Here is an example using the `dotenv` library.

First we need to create a file named `.env` with the settings:

```python
username=testuser
password=testpwd
```

Then load it in our notebook, and use it to request tokens:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
from urllib import request, parse
import json

load_dotenv()
user = os.environ.get("username")
pwd = os.environ.get("password")

url = "https://oidc.provider:443/as/token.oauth2"
data = parse.urlencode( {
    "grant_type": "password",
    "username": user,
    "password": pwd,
    "scope": "openid",
    "client_id": "testclient"
} ).encode()
req = request.Request(url=url, data=data)
req.add_header("Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded")
with request.urlopen(req) as f:
    body = f.read().decode(f.headers.get_content_charset())
    resp = json.loads(body)
    access_token = resp["access_token"]
```

#### Enable ROPC

The Resource Owner Password Credentials flow can be enabled in QuestDB within
`server.conf`:

```
acl.oidc.ropc.flow.enabled = true
```

> Note that the flow also has to be configured in the OAuth2/OIDC provider.
> See an example using
> [PingFederate with Active Directory](/docs/guides/active-directory-pingfederate/#enable-resource-owner-password-credentials-ropc-flow).

Now we can use Basic Authentication to simplify our code. We send the
credentials to QuestDB, and the database will validate the credentials against
the OAuth2 provider.

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
from urllib import request
import base64

load_dotenv()
user = os.environ.get("username")
pwd = os.environ.get("password")

query = parse.urlencode({
    "query": "select current_user()"
})
req = request.Request(f"http://localhost:9000/exec?{query}")
b64credentials = base64.standard_b64encode(f"{user}:{pwd}".encode()).decode()
req.add_header("Authorization", f"Basic {b64credentials}")
with request.urlopen(req) as f:
    body = f.read().decode(f.headers.get_content_charset())
    resp = json.loads(body)
    print(resp)
```

We can also use a postgres client to connect to the database:

:::note

QuestDB never persists the user's credentials.

:::

```python
import psycopg as pg
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()
user = os.environ.get("username")
pwd = os.environ.get("password")

conn_str = f"user={user} password={pwd} host=localhost port=8812 dbname=qdb"
with pg.connect(conn_str, autocommit=True) as connection:
    with connection.cursor() as cur:
        cur.execute("select current_user()")
        records = cur.fetchall()
        for row in records:
            print(row)
```

### CLI, standalone applications

When using CLI tools, such as `psql`, or standalone applications like Microsoft
Access, the best option may be the Resource Owner Password Credentials flow.

The user logs in with their SSO credentials, and the server validates the
details with the OAuth2 provider:

```shell
% psql -h localhost -p 8812 -U testuser
Password for user testuser:
psql (14.2, server 11.3)
Type "help" for help.

testldap=>
testldap=>
```

## Non-interactive clients

Non-interactive clients are usually jobs or standalone applications, such as a
client for ingesting data. It is practical to manage their credentials via an
OAuth2 provider too.

As seen in the Jupyter notebook examples, the clients can request a token
themselves and then use it to authorise data ingestion:

```python
import json
import os
import requests
import pandas as pd
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from questdb.ingress import Sender

load_dotenv()
user = os.environ.get("username")
pwd = os.environ.get("password")

token_endpoint = "https://oidc.provider:443/as/token.oauth2"
response = requests.post(token_endpoint,
                         data={"grant_type": "password",
                               "client_id": "testclient",
                               "username": user,
                               "password": pwd,
                               "scope": "openid"},
                         headers={"Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"})

response_body = response.content.decode("utf-8")
tokens = json.loads(response_body)
access_token = tokens["access_token"]

conf = f"http::addr=localhost:9000;token={access_token};"
with Sender.from_conf(conf) as sender:
    df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
    df["ts"] = pd.to_datetime(df["ts"])
    sender.dataframe(df, table_name="foo", at="ts")
```

Alternatively, a user may rely on QuestDB to authenticate them via the OAuth2
provider when the Resource Owner Password Credentials flow is enabled on the
server side:

```python
import os
import pandas as pd
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from questdb.ingress import Sender

load_dotenv()
user = os.environ.get("username")
pwd = os.environ.get("password")

conf = f"http::addr=localhost:9000;username={user};password={pwd};"
with Sender.from_conf(conf) as sender:
    df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
    df["ts"] = pd.to_datetime(df["ts"])
    sender.dataframe(df, table_name="foo", at="ts")
```

## User permissions

QuestDB requires additional user information to be able to construct the user's
access list.

As a reminder, the access list is the list of permissions that determines what
the user can and cannot do.

QuestDB itself does not store external users, nor their passwords or any other
authentication related detail.

External users and their authentication methods are managed by the Identity
Provider.

Since external users are not managed by QuestDB, permissions cannot be granted
to them directly.

Instead, the database expects a list of groups, called the _groups claim_ to be
present in the user information.

These external group names are mapped to QuestDB's own groups.

The access list of the external user consists of the permissions granted to
those groups:

<Screenshot
  alt="OpenID setup"
  src="images/docs/guide/oidc/oidc-setup-3.webp"
  title="User permissions"
  width={550}
/>

### Mapping user permissions

The mappings between external and QuestDB groups are managed with the following
SQL commands:

```questdb-sql title="Create a group which is mapped to an Active Directory group"
CREATE GROUP groupName WITH EXTERNAL ALIAS 'CN=TestGroup1,OU=DC Users,DC=ad,DC=quest,DC=dev';
```

```questdb-sql title="Map an Active Directory group to an already existing QuestDB group"
ALTER GROUP groupName WITH EXTERNAL ALIAS 'CN=TestGroup1,OU=DC Users,DC=ad,DC=quest,DC=dev';
```

```questdb-sql title="Remove an Active Directory mapping without deleting the QuestDB group"
ALTER GROUP groupName DROP EXTERNAL ALIAS 'CN=TestGroup1,OU=DC Users,DC=ad,DC=quest,DC=dev';
```

QuestDB works the list of external groups out from the User Info response
message.

If we take the example used earlier, we will see that the message contains a
claim called `groups`. This name is configurable in QuestDB.

If the groups claim is missing or it is an empty list, the user cannot access
the database.

Although the user is authenticated, they have no permissions at all.

The user has to have at least the `HTTP` permission to be able to successfully
login via the [Web Console](/docs/web-console/).

```json title="User info response example with Active Directory groups"
{
  "sub": "externalUser",
  "name": "External User",
  "groups": [
    "CN=TestGroup1,OU=DC Users,DC=ad,DC=quest,DC=dev",
    "CN=TestGroup2,OU=DC Users,DC=ad,DC=quest,DC=dev"
  ]
}
```

Any change made to the user's group membership in the Identity Provider, QuestDB
will adjust the user's access list.

:::note

There may be a slight delay due to the User Info Cache.

QuestDB will use the cached information until it becomes stale, and gets
updated.

:::

The same stands for changes made to the user's status within the Identity
Provider.

For example, a disabled user will not be kicked out of QuestDB immediately.

The `acl.oidc.cache.ttl` config option drives how often user information should
be synchronized with the Identity Providers.

It should be set accordingly to your organization's policies.

Other parts of the user information, such as the `sub` and the `name` also used
by QuestDB.

They could be displayed in the [Web Console](/docs/web-console/), or appear in
the logs, for example.

## Configuration options

For all OIDC-related configuration options of QuestDB, see
[Configuration](/docs/configuration/#openid-connect-oidc).

<br />

## Active Directory

The following sections are guides for how to set up single sign-on (SSO) with various authorisation providers.

### PingFederate

This document helps set up SSO authentication for the Web Console in
[PingFederate](https://www.pingidentity.com/en/platform/capabilities/authentication-authority/pingfederate.html).

It is assumed that the Azure Active Directory serves as the Identity Provider
(IdP).

For a general introduction to OpenID Connect and QuestDB, see the
[OIDC Operations page](/docs/operations/openid-connect-oidc-integration/).

#### Set up PingFederate client

First thing first, let's pick a name for the client!

<Screenshot
  alt="PingFederate image, naming the client."
  src="images/guides/active-directory/1.webp"
  title="Picking a name"
  width={750}
/>

The QuestDB [Web Console](/docs/web-console/) is a SPA (Single Page App).

As a result, it cannot store safely a client secret.

Instead it can use PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) to secure the flow.

As shown above, leave the client authentication disabled.

We also have to white list the URL of the [Web Console](/docs/web-console/) as a redirection URL:

<Screenshot
  alt="PingFederate image, redirection URL"
  src="images/guides/active-directory/2.webp"
  title="Whitelist the redirection URL"
  width={600}
/>

We can instruct PingFederate to automatically authorize the scopes requested by
the [Web Console](/docs/web-console/).

The user will not be presented the extra window asking for consent after
authentication:

<Screenshot
  alt="PingFederate, bypass approval"
  src="images/guides/active-directory/3.webp"
  title="Bypass, please"
  width={500}
/>

The [Web Console](/docs/web-console/) uses the
[Authorization Code Flow](/docs/operations/openid-connect-oidc-integration/#authentication-and-authorization-flow),
and refreshes tokens automatically.

Next, enable the grant types required for this flow:

<Screenshot
  alt="PingFederate, granting types"
  src="images/guides/active-directory/4.webp"
  title="Granted"
  width={600}
/>

We've selected:

- Authorization Code
- Refresh Token
- Access Token Validation (Client is a Resource Server)

After that, select the token manager for the client.

The token manager is responsible for issuing access tokens.

All token related settings should be configured in the token manager.

<Screenshot
  alt=""
  src="images/guides/active-directory/5.webp"
  title="PKCE enabled"
  width={500}
/>

Finally, enable PKCE - as shown above - and save the settings.

#### Access Token Manager settings

QuestDB does not require any special setup regarding the access token.

We recommend that you do not to use shorter tokens than the default 28
characters.

As the QuestDB [Web Console](/docs/web-console/) refreshes the token automatically, there is no need
for long-lived tokens:

<Screenshot
  alt="PingFederate, access token management UI"
  src="images/guides/active-directory/6.webp"
  title="Click to zoom"
  jumbo={true}
/>

We've selected:

- Token length: 28
- Token lifetime: 5
- Lifetime extension policy: None
- Maximum token lifetime: Null
- Lifetime extension threshold percentage: 30

For the next step, we tune the Authorization Server.

#### Authorization Server settings

These settings relate to the authorization code, refresh token and CORS.

<Screenshot
  alt="PingFederate, auth server image"
  src="images/guides/active-directory/7.webp"
  title="Authorization server"
  width={750}
/>

In this section, we've entered:

- Authorization code timeout: 60
- Authorization code entropy: 30
- Client secret retention period: 0

Next, ensure the `ROLL REFRESH TOKEN VALUES` option is selected:

<Screenshot
  alt="PingFederate, auth server settings ui"
  src="images/guides/active-directory/8.webp"
  title="Click to zoom"
  jumbo={true}
/>

It is also important to whitelist the [Web Console](/docs/web-console/)'s URL on the CORS list:

<Screenshot
  alt="PingFederate, authorization server ui"
  src="images/guides/active-directory/9.webp"
  title="Port 9000, or your custom port"
  width={500}
/>

#### Set up a Microsoft Entra ID Data Source

PingFederate needs a Data Source setup.

This is a secure LDAP connection to Microsoft Entra ID, formerly known as Azure
Active Directory.

The data source needs a:

- name
- hostname
- port
- username and password for the LDAP connection

<Screenshot
  alt="PingFederate, data and credential storage"
  src="images/guides/active-directory/10.webp"
  title="Configuring our data source"
  width={750}
/>

We have given it the name EntraDS and it will be applied later.

#### Set up a Password Credential Validator

Now that PingFederate has an LDAP connection, we can use it for authentication.

First, create a Password Credential Validator:

<Screenshot
  alt="PingFederate, create a PCV view "
  src="images/guides/active-directory/11.webp"
  title="Create the PCV"
  width={750}
/>

We've entered:

- Instance name: EntraPCV
- Instance ID: EntraPCV
- Selected: LDAP Username Password Credential Validator
- Parent instance: None

Furthermore, we now declare our previously created data source (`EntraDS`):

<Screenshot
  alt="PingFederate, additional PCV details"
  src="images/guides/active-directory/12.webp"
  title="Click to zoom"
  jumbo={true}
/>

This links our data store (`EntraDS`) to our PCV (`EntraPCV`).

#### Set up an Identity Provider

We can use our PCV once we set up an Identity Provider.

The IdP will be used to authenticate users against Active Directory using the
LDAP connection.

We do this in the Type subsection:

<Screenshot
  alt="PingFederate, IdP adapters"
  src="images/guides/active-directory/13.webp"
  title="Defining an adapter"
  width={750}
/>
Next, in the IdP Adapter section...

Click: Add a new row to Credential Validators.

Select the PCV (`EntraPCV`) we created.

Optionally alter number of retries:

<Screenshot
  alt="PingFederate, selecting PCV "
  src="images/guides/active-directory/14.webp"
  title="Select the PCV"

#### Add groups to OIDC policy management

QuestDB now needs to know about the user's AD group memberships to find their
permissions.

Groups are passed to QuestDB inside the User Info object in a custom claim.

This has to be added in the OpenID Connect Policy Management.

The field is Multi-Valued, because it is a list of group names.

Under the Attribute Contract subsection, see:

/>

Next, click to the Attribute Scopes subsection.

Ensure `groups` is among the `openid` attributes:

Onwards to the Attribute Sources & User Lookup Section.

From this view, you can add local data stores.

Note item `test` of type of LDAP:

  title="Click to zoom"
  jumbo={true}
/>

Note where we specified the Data Store (`EntraDS`).

This is also where the directory search parameters are defined.

Back at the Attribute Sources & User Lookup Section section, note we have set
`email`.

The source is `LDAP (test)`, while the value is `usePrincipalName`:

And finally!

In the same Attribute Sources & User Lookup Section...

Find `groups`.

Note the definition of Source (`LDAP (test)`) that bridges our various parts.

The value is `memberOf`.

#### Enable Resource Owner Password Credentials (ROPC) flow

As described in the
[OIDC operations document](/docs/operations/openid-connect-oidc-integration/#enable-ropc)
tools - such as `psql` - can be integrated with the OIDC provider using the ROPC flow.

When setting this flow up, enable the Resource Owner Password Credentials flow in the
client settings.

Next, create a Resource Owner Credentials Grant Mapping to map values obtained from
the Password Credential Validator (PCV) into the persistent grants.

When setting this up, select the previously created LDAP Data Source and IdP Adapter, which links
to the existing PCV.

Then select the `username` attribute of the PCV as `USER_KEY`.

#### Confirm QuestDB mappings and login

QuestDB requires a mapping, as laid out in the
[OIDC operations document](/docs/operations/openid-connect-oidc-integration/#mapping-user-permissions).

If a given user has the HTTP permission, they will be able to now login via the
[Web Console](/docs/web-console/).

To test, head to [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) and login.

If all has been wired up well, then login will succeed.

### Microsoft EntraId

This document sets up SSO authentication for the [QuestDB Web Console](/docs/web-console/) in
[Microsoft EntraID](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id), formerly known as Azure AD.

For a general introduction to OpenID Connect and QuestDB, see the
[OIDC Operations page](/docs/operations/openid-connect-oidc-integration/).

#### Set up the client application in Entra ID

First thing first, let's pick a name for the client!

Then head to _Microsoft Entra Admin Center_, and register the application
under _Identity - App registrations - New registration_.

<Screenshot
  alt="EntraID image, app registration."
  src="images/guides/active-directory-entraid/1_app_registration.webp"
  title="App registration"
  width={750}
/>

The QuestDB [Web Console](/docs/web-console/) is a SPA (Single Page App).

As a result, it cannot store safely a client secret.

Instead, it can use PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) to secure the flow.

When registering the application, select the SPA platform.

We also have to specify the URL of the [Web Console](/docs/web-console/) as Redirect URI.

<Screenshot
  alt="EntraID image, SPA and redirection URI"
  src="images/guides/active-directory-entraid/2_spa_redirect_uri.webp"
  title="Add SPA platform with the redirection URI"
  width={600}
/>

After clicking _Register_, we have created a client application with the
name _QuestDB_.

Each application is assigned a unique id (known as Client ID in the
OAuth2 - OIDC standard). The client will identify itself with this id
when sending requests to Entra ID.

<Screenshot
alt="EntraID image, application ID"
src="images/guides/active-directory-entraid/3_application_id.webp"
title="Application ID"
width={600}
/>

We find the platform configurations under _Authentication_. This is the place where
the previously set redirect URI can be viewed and modified. We can also specify
additional redirect URIs, if necessary.

The redirect URIs of the application are automatically eligible for the
_Authorization Code Flow with PKCE_, which is a special version of the OAuth2 standard's
Authorization Code Flow. It is specifically designed for applications where a client
secret (e.g. a password) could not be kept safely. As single page applications run in
the browser, they fall into this category.

The redirect URIs are also added to the _CORS_ (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy
of EntraID. CORS is a mechanism to allow a web page, such as the Web Console, to access
resources from a different domain than the one that served the page. In this context
this means that we let the Web Console to access Entra ID, while its origin is the
HTTP endpoint of QuestDB.

<Screenshot
alt="EntraID image, PKCE and CORS"
src="images/guides/active-directory-entraid/4_cors_pkce.webp"
title="PKCE and CORS"
width={600}
/>

If we scroll down to the bottom of this page, we can also find a section where we
can enable the _Resource Owner Password Credential Flow_.

This OAuth2 flow is legacy, and should be enabled only if there is a requirement
of connecting to QuestDB using SSO (Single Sign-On) via clients not supporting
redirect based web flows.
This could mean a Postgres client without OAuth2 integration, such as _psql_, or
a standalone in-house client application, or could be just a jupyter notebook.

The main issue with this flow is that the client application has to be trusted
with the user's login details. The user's credentials are passed to the
application, in this case to QuestDB, and the client application uses these
credentials to authenticate the user by forwarding them to the identity provider,
in this case to Entra ID.

It is guaranteed that QuestDB does not store the user's credentials in any way.
They are not persisted into the database, not even in encrypted form.
The login details are treated as passthrough information. Only exception is
that server logs can contain the username, logged for audit purposes.

<Screenshot
alt="EntraID image, enable ROPC"
src="images/guides/active-directory-entraid/5_ropc.webp"
title="Enable ROPC"
width={600}
/>

Our next stop is the _Token configuration_, where the OAuth2/OIDC access and ID
tokens can be customized.

Note that users can be authenticated without customized tokens, but authorization
would prove to be challenging. The user's security groups are not included
in the tokens by default.

QuestDB can be configured to request the user's groups from the UserInfo
endpoint of the OAuth2 server, but Entra ID cannot be configured to provide
this information via the UserInfo endpoint.
Therefore, we choose to customize the tokens, QuestDB will decode and
validate the ID token, and take the group information from there.

QuestDB authorization relies on receiving the group memberships of the user.
Entra ID groups should be mapped to QuestDB groups, and permissions can be
granted to the QuestDB groups. Detailed information about group mappings can
be found in the [OIDC integration](/docs/operations/openid-connect-oidc-integration/#user-permissions)
documentation.

<Screenshot
alt="EntraID image, token customization"
src="images/guides/active-directory-entraid/6_token_customization.webp"
title="Token customization"
width={600}
/>

The customized tokens contain user information which cannot be accessed
without permission. User information is provided by Microsoft Graph, so
the client application needs specific permissions to access
Microsoft Graph APIs.

These permissions can be configured under _API permissions_. It is important
to note that we will be setting _Delegated_ permissions here, meaning we
are not granting actual permissions to access user data. Instead, each user
logging into QuestDB will have to consent to accessing their user profile.

<Screenshot
alt="EntraID image, API permissions"
src="images/guides/active-directory-entraid/7_API_permissions.webp"
title="API permissions"
width={600}
/>

By default, the _User.Read_ permission is added to the list, but what we
really need is:
 - openid: to be able to issue ID tokens
 - profile: to access user information
 - offline_access: to be able to issue refresh tokens

By clicking on _Microsoft Graph_ we can select and add these permissions.

<Screenshot
alt="EntraID image, add openid permissions"
src="images/guides/active-directory-entraid/8_add_openid_permissions.webp"
title="Add openid permissions"
width={600}
/>

The _User.Read_ permission is not needed. It can be removed by clicking
on the `...` at the end of the row, and selecting _Remove permission_ from
the popup menu.

<Screenshot
alt="EntraID image, permissions final"
src="images/guides/active-directory-entraid/9_permissions_final.webp"
title="Permissions final list"
width={600}
/>

With this we have finished setting up the QuestDB client application
in Entra ID, and now we can wire QuestDB and Entra ID together by
adding OIDC configuration to QuestDB.

#### QuestDB configuration

The below should be set in QuestDB's `server.conf`:

```shell
# enable OIDC
acl.oidc.enabled=true

# the claim contains the username or user id
acl.oidc.sub.claim=name

# the claim contains the user's group memberships
acl.oidc.groups.claim=groups

# groups are encoded in the token
acl.oidc.groups.encoded.in.token=true

# OIDC configuration endpoint of Entra ID
acl.oidc.configuration.url=https://login.microsoftonline.com/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration

# application ID taken from Entra ID
acl.oidc.client.id=8de84b90-1ea5-4e41-9e84-dba860aa01a6

# redirect URI, QuestDB's HTTP endpoint
acl.oidc.redirect.uri=http://localhost:9000

# OAuth scopes the user has to consent to
acl.oidc.scope=openid profile offline_access

# enable ROPC flow
# optional, required only if ROPC is enabled in Entra ID
acl.oidc.ropc.flow.enabled=true
```

The application ID and the OIDC configuration endpoint's URL can be found
in the Overview of the application in Entra ID.

The application ID is displayed right under the application's name, the
OIDC configuration endpoint is displayed on the panel which opens up when
the _Endpoints_ button is clicked.

<Screenshot
alt="EntraID image, overview"
src="images/guides/active-directory-entraid/10_overview.webp"
title="Application overview"
width={600}
/>

#### Map groups and grant permissions

Now we can start QuestDB, and login with the built-in admin to create
group mappings.

As mentioned earlier, authorization works by mapping Entra ID groups
to QuestDB groups. When the user logs in, QuestDB decodes Entra ID
group memberships from the token, then finds the QuestDB groups
mapped to them, and the user gets the permissions based on the
mapped groups.

```questdb-sql title="Create a group which is mapped to an Entra ID group"
CREATE GROUP extUsers WITH EXTERNAL ALIAS '87654321-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc';
```
The above command maps the Entra ID group identified by object
id `87654321-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc` to a QuestDB group called `extUsers`.

We should grant the necessary QuestDB endpoint permissions first
to make sure users can access the Web Console, Postgres and ILP
interfaces as required. [Read more about endpoint permissions](/docs/operations/rbac/#endpoint-permissions).

```questdb-sql title="Grant endpoint permissions"
GRANT HTTP, PGWIRE TO groupName;
```

Now we can grant the rest of the permissions as required. We can
grant access to tables, for example.

```questdb-sql title="Grant database permissions"
GRANT SELECT ON table1, table2 to groupName;
```

#### Confirm group mappings and login

To test, head to the Web Console and login.

If all has been wired up well, then login will succeed, and the user
will have the access granted to them.

## Syntax

![Flow chart showing the syntax of the DROP GROUP keyword](/images/docs/diagrams/dropGroup.svg)

## Description

`DROP GROUP` removes an existing group.

Unless the `IF EXISTS` clause is applied, an error is raised and the command
fails if the group does not exist.

When a group is removed, all members of the group lose the permissions inherited
through the group.

## Examples

```questdb-sql
DROP GROUP admins;

DROP GROUP IF EXISTS admins;
```

It can be verified with:

```questdb-sql
SHOW GROUPS;
```

that does not include `admins` in its result.

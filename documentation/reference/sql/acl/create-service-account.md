## Syntax

![Flow chart showing the syntax of the CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT keyword](/images/docs/diagrams/createServiceAccount.svg)

## Description

`CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT` adds a new service account with no permissions.

The chosen name must be unique across all users (including the built-in admin),
groups and service accounts. If the name has already been reserved, the command
fails and an error is raised, unless the `IF NOT EXISTS` clause is included in
the statement.

Note that new service accounts can only access the database if the necessary
[endpoint permissions](/docs/operations/rbac/#endpoint-permissions) have been
granted.

The user creating the service account automatically receives the
`ASSUME SERVICE ACCOUNT` permission with `GRANT` option, unless the `OWNED BY`
clause is present, in which case the permission is granted to the user or
group specified in the clause.

The `OWNED BY` clause cannot be omitted if the service account is created by
an external user, because permissions cannot be granted to them.

## Examples

```questdb-sql
CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT audit;

CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT IF NOT EXISTS audit;
```

```
CREATE GROUP analysts;
CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT dashboard OWNED BY analysts;

```

It can be verified with:

```questdb-sql
SHOW SERVICE ACCOUNT audit;
```

that yields:

| auth_type  | enabled |
| ---------- | ------- |
| Password   | false   |
| JWK Token  | false   |
| REST Token | false   |

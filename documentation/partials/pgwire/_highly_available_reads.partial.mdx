## Highly-Available Reads with QuestDB Enterprise

QuestDB Enterprise supports running [multiple replicas](https://questdb.com/docs/high-availability/setup/) to serve queries.
Client applications can specify **multiple hosts** in the connection string. This ensures that initial connections
succeed even if a node is down. If the connected node fails later, the application should catch the error, reconnect to
another host, and retry the read.

See our blog post for background and the companion repository for a minimal example:

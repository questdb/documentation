[Grafana](https://grafana.com/) is a popular observability and monitoring
application used to visualize data and enable time-series data analysis.

QuestDB is available within Grafana via the
[official QuestDB plugin](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/questdb-questdb-datasource/).

For a walk-through style guide, see our
[blog post](/blog/time-series-monitoring-dashboard-grafana-questdb/).

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](/docs/deployment/docker/) to run both Grafana and QuestDB
  - We will use the `--add-host` parameter for both Grafana and QuestDB.

## Start Grafana

Start Grafana using `docker run`:

```shell
docker run --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
-p 3000:3000 --name=grafana \
-v grafana-storage:/var/lib/grafana \
grafana/grafana-oss
```

Once the Grafana server has started, you can access it via port 3000
([http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)). The default login credentials
are as follows:

```shell
user:admin
password:admin
```

## Start QuestDB

The Docker version runs on port `8812` for the database connection and port
`9000` for the Web Console and REST interface:

```shell
docker run --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
-p 9000:9000 -p 9009:9009 -p 8812:8812 -p 9003:9003 \
-v "$(pwd):/var/lib/questdb" \
-e QDB_PG_READONLY_USER_ENABLED=true \
questdb/questdb:latest
```

## Add a data source

1. Open Grafana's UI (by default available at
   [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000))
2. Navigate to the bottom of the page and click **Find more data source
   plugins**.
3. Search for QuestDB and click **Install**.
4. Once the QuestDB data source for Grafana is finished installing, click on the
   blue **Add new data source** button where the **Install** button used to be.
   Configure it with the following settings:

```
Server address:host.docker.internal
Server port: 8812
Username:user
Password:quest
TLS/SSL mode:disable
```

5. Toggle the **Query Builder** to **SQL Editor** by clicking the button.

6. Write SQL queries!

## Real-time refresh rates

By default, Grafana limits the maximum refresh rate of your dashboards. The
maximum default rate is to refresh every 5 seconds. This is to provide relief to
the database under-the-hood. However, with QuestBD's significant performance
optimizations, we can lower this rate for greater fluidity.

To learn how, see our
[blog post](/blog/increase-grafana-refresh-rate-frequency/).

## Global variables

Use
[global variables](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/variables/variable-types/global-variables/#global-variables)
to simplify queries with dynamic elements such as date range filters.

### `$__timeFilter(timestamp)`

This variable allows filtering results by sending a start-time and end-time to
QuestDB. This expression evaluates to:

```questdb-sql
timestamp BETWEEN
    '2018-02-01T00:00:00Z' AND '2018-02-28T23:59:59Z'
```

### `$__interval`

This variable calculates a dynamic interval based on the time range applied to
the dashboard. By using this function, the sampling interval changes
automatically as the user zooms in and out of the panel.

```questdb-sql title="An example of $__interval"
SELECT
  pickup_datetime AS time,
  avg(trip_distance) AS distance
FROM taxi_trips
WHERE $__timeFilter(pickup_datetime)
SAMPLE BY $__interval;
```

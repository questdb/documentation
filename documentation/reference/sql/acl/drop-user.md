## Syntax

![Flow chart showing the syntax of the DROP USER keyword](/images/docs/diagrams/dropUser.svg)

## Description

`DROP USER` removes an existing user.

**All related secrets are also deleted.**

Unless the `IF EXISTS` clause is applied, an error is raised and the command
fails if the user does not exist.

## Examples

```questdb-sql
DROP USER john;

DROP USER IF EXISTS john;
```

It can be verified with:

```questdb-sql
SHOW USERS;
```

that does not include `john` in its result.

import Screenshot from "@theme/Screenshot"

OpenID Connect (OIDC) integrates with Identity Providers (IdP) external to
QuestDB.

It is a convenient way to integrate QuestDB into your enterprise environment,
and it provides SSO (Single Sign-On) for the [Web Console](/docs/web-console/).

Microsoft Active Directory and Azure AD, for example, can be turned into an
Identity Provider.

Specific installation steps depend on the type of the provider.

:::note

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is only available in QuestDB Enterprise.

:::

## Active Directory

See our example using
[PingFederate with Active Directory](/docs/guides/active-directory-pingfederate/).

## Architecture overview

Altogether, the architecture appears as such:

<Screenshot
  alt="Overall architecture"
  src="/img/docs/guide/oidc/oidc-architecture.webp"
  title="Architecture diagram"
  width={750}
/>

We can break it down into core components.

### Web Console

QuestDB's interactive UI. Users must authenticate before accessing the database
via the interface.

The [Web Console](/docs/web-console/) uses PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) to
secure the authentication and authorization flow.

In OAuth2/OIDC terms, the [Web Console](/docs/web-console/) is referred to as
the _client_, and it is assigned an identifier: the **Client Id**.

Each application which integrates via OIDC should be given a different **Client
Id**.

### OIDC Provider

Typically consists of a number of modules.

We are interested in two of them only.

1. The _Identity Provider_ holds user identities and user information, capable
   of authenticating users, and to issue an ID Token which uniquely identify
   them.

2. The _Authorization Server_ grants access to resources, such as a database, in
   the form of access tokens.

The OIDC Provider usually integrates with a number of applications which require
different access to a number of resources.

These clients communicate with the OIDC Provider via its endpoints.

It exposes a number of APIs, including the Authorization, Token and User Info
endpoints.

### QuestDB

The database, in OAuth2/OIDC terms the _protected resource_ or _resource
server_.

Only processes requests which contain a valid access token.

## Authentication and Authorization Flow

The OAuth2/OIDC standard defines different ways of obtaining access and ID
tokens from the OIDC Provider, referred to as the "_flow_".

The goal of this flow is to get the user, who is sitting in front of the Web
Console, authenticated.

Then, it allows QuestDB to determine the user's permissions based on user
information provided by the Identity Providers.

Specifically, the QuestDB [Web Console](/docs/web-console/) uses the
`Authorization Code Flow with PKCE` option.

It consists of ten steps...

#### 1. Secret generation

First the [Web Console](/docs/web-console/) generates a cryptographically strong
random secret called the _code verifier_.

The secret is hashed using the _SHA256 algorithm_. The result is the _code
challenge_.

After PKCE initialization the [Web Console](/docs/web-console/) requests an
_authorization code_ from the OIDC Provider.

It calls the Authorization endpoint with a few parameters, including the:

- **Client Id**
- requested scopes (the list of scopes are configurable, default is `openid`
  only)
- code challenge
- algorithm used to generate the code challenge from the code verifier (SHA256)

When the Authorization Server receives the request, it checks if the user has
been authenticated already:

- If the user has a valid session, it can be provided with an authorization code
  straight away, so we jump to step 4.

- If the user does not have a valid session yet, it will be redirected to the
  Identity Provider for authentication.

```bash title="Authorization code request example"
https://oidc.provider:443/as/authorization.oauth2?client_id=questdb&response_type=code&scope=openid&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fquestdb.host%3A9000&code_challenge=IwZ-WuypAY3fMtvismbj1MQUe5CzMgrBa87nYcgFoLQ&code_challenge_method=S256
```

#### 2. Prove identity

Next, the user must prove its identity.

This could be a username with:

- a password,
- an OTP
- facial recognition via a mobile app
- or anything else supported by the Identity Provider.

<Screenshot
  alt="Creating profiles"
  src="/img/docs/guide/oidc/oidc-setup-1.webp"
  title="Prove identity"
  width={450}
/>

#### 3. Scope consent

After successful authentication, the user provides consent for the requested
scopes.

The list of scopes are configurable.

By default the Web Console requests only the `openid` scope which is mandatory
for OIDC.

No ID Token is issued without it.

The OIDC provider can be configured to provide the consent automatically,
without presenting the user with an additional screen in the browser.

<Screenshot
  alt="Openid and profile"
  src="/img/docs/guide/oidc/oidc-setup-2.webp"
  title="Scope consent"
  width={650}
/>

#### 4. Redirection

Consent is granted!

The Authorization Server redirects the user back to the
[Web Console](/docs/web-console/) with the _authorization code_:

```bash title="Authorization code response example"
https://questdb.host:9000/?code=1L344XEY5XRka1j4ySNa8bVQSLf71as9uGLEuv_A
```

#### 5. Credential request

Now, the QuestDB [Web Console](/docs/web-console/) requests the ID and access
tokens from the Token endpoint of the OIDC Provider with the authorization code.

It includes the Client ID and the PKCE code verifier together with the
authorization code in the request.

The endpoint then hashes the code verifier using the method specified previously
in step 1.

The result must match the code challenge, also provided in step 1.

The matching code challenge proves that the token is requested by the client
which requested the authorization code, and it was not stolen:

```bash title="Token request example"
POST https://oidc.provider:443/as/token.oauth2 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
grant_type=authorization_code&code=1L344XEY5XRka1j4ySNa8bVQSLf71as9uGLEuv_A&client_id=questdb&&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fquestdb.host%3A9000&code_verifier=uGZh4sQffXLgRna7D-jtEAkuXzp7Lm_okZXBljzP38coAD44kEheIaz7Pdh98KxYtYLZHNiQPCczQYeF
```

#### 6. Credentials received

If the PKCE check is passed, the Web Console receives the ID and access tokens.

There is a third token in the response too, the refresh token.

The refresh token is used by the Web Console to refresh the access token before
it expires.

Without the refresh token mechanism, the user would be forced to re-authenticate
when the access token expires.

The validity of the tokens are configurable inside the OIDC Provider.

```json title="Token response example"
{
  "access_token": "gslpJtzmmi6RwaPSx0dYGD4tEkom",
  "refresh_token": "FUuAAqMp6LSTKmkUd5uZuodhiE4Kr6M7Eyv.eg83ge",
  "id_token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6I...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 300 // In seconds, thus 5 minutes
}
```

#### 7. Database access

With the tokens, the Web Console can interact with the database.

The access token is in the header of every request sent to QuestDB.

> **Worried about exposing the token?** It is rather opaque and does not contain
> user details.

To carry out permission checks, the database has to know more about the user.

For this, QuestDB has a User Info Cache.

If it finds a valid entry with the access token in the cache, steps 8 and 9 are
skipped:

```bash title="Query request example"
https://questdb.host:9999/exec?query=select%20current_user()
Authorization: Bearer gslpJtzmmi6RwaPSx0dYGD4tEkom
```

#### 8. Find user information

No user information in the cache, or stale information?

QuestDB uses the access token to request user information from the OIDC
Provider's User Info endpoint.

This call also serves as token validation.

If the token is not real or has been expired, the User Info endpoint replies
with an error:

```bash title="User info request example"
https://oidc.provider:443/idp/userinfo.openid
Authorization: Bearer gslpJtzmmi6RwaPSx0dYGD4tEkom
```

#### 9. Receive user information

If the access token is valid, QuestDB receives the required user information
from the endpoint, then updates its cache.

The cache improves performance, as QuestDB does not have to turn to the OIDC
Provider on every single request.

Do note that cache expiry is configurable:

```json title="User info response example with Active Directory groups"
{
  "sub": "externalUser",
  "name": "External User",
  "groups": [
    "CN=TestGroup1,OU=DC Users,DC=ad,DC=quest,DC=dev",
    "CN=TestGroup2,OU=DC Users,DC=ad,DC=quest,DC=dev"
  ]
}
```

#### 10. Permission check

With the help of the user information, QuestDB can carry out
[permission checks](#user-permissions).

If the permission check is successful, the database will process the request,
and then sends the results back:

```json title="Query response example"
{
  "query": "select current_user()",
  "columns": [
    {
      "name": "current_user",
      "type": "STRING"
    }
  ],
  "dataset": [["External User"]],
  "count": 1,
  "timestamp": -1
}
```

## Other interactive clients

Any interactive client - a UI, Jupyter notebook, CLI - can integrate with an
OIDC provider. However, the level of support will vary between these tools.

Interactive clients usually fall into one of the following categories:

- Browser-based clients with support for HTTP redirects; this includes the Web
  Console or any javascript UI
- Applications running in a browser without support for redirects, such as
  Jupyter notebooks
- Non-browser based clients, usually some kind of command line interface (CLI)
  or a standalone application, such as Microsoft Access

### Browser-based clients

If the tool is browser based and can handle HTTP redirects, it can implement two
possible flows to request an access token.:

1. [Authorization Code](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth)
   flow **(Recommended, more secure)**

2. [Implicit](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ImplicitFlowAuth)
   flow

The Web Console implements the
[Authorization Code Flow with PKCE](https://oauth.net/2/pkce), which is a
special version of the Authorization Code flow designed for mobile apps and
single page applications.

Regardless of which flow is used by the web or mobile application, the requested
access token can be used for authentication and authorization when communicating
with QuestDB as explained in the [above 7th step](#7-database-access).

### Jupyter notebook

JupyterHub can integrate with OAuth2 providers using OAuthenticator, as
described in its
[documentation](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/explanation/oauth.html).
The OAuthenticator documentation also contains
[examples](https://oauthenticator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/provider-specific-setup/index.html)
using different identity providers.

If Jupyter notebooks are used without JupyterHub, one option for OAuth2
integration is to use the
[Resource Owner Password Credentials](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/password)
flow. It is likely that to enable this flow in your OAuth2 provider will require
additional setup. The Resource Owner Password Credentials flow is legacy, and
should be used as a last resort.

We can use the code below to acquire an access token in our notebook:

```python
from urllib import request, parse
import json

url = "https://oidc.provider:443/as/token.oauth2"
data = parse.urlencode( {
    "grant_type": "password",
    "username": "testuser",
    "password": "testpwd",
    "scope": "openid",
    "client_id": "testclient"
} ).encode()
req = request.Request(url=url, data=data)
req.add_header("Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded")
with request.urlopen(req) as f:
    body = f.read().decode(f.headers.get_content_charset())
    resp = json.loads(body)
    access_token = resp["access_token"]
```

This token can be used to authenticate with QuestDB:

```python
query = parse.urlencode({
    "query": "select current_user()"
})
req = request.Request(f"http://localhost:9000/exec?{query}")
req.add_header("Authorization", f"Bearer {access_token}")
with request.urlopen(req) as f:
    body = f.read().decode(f.headers.get_content_charset())
    resp = json.loads(body)
    print(resp)
```

#### Externalizing credentials

The above example saves the user's credentials into the notebook, potentially
exposing them to others. One way to improve this is to use environment variables
or files to externalize the username and password.

Here is an example using the `dotenv` library.

First we need to create a file named `.env` with the settings:

```python
username=testuser
password=testpwd
```

Then load it in our notebook, and use it to request tokens:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
from urllib import request, parse
import json

load_dotenv()
user = os.environ.get("username")
pwd = os.environ.get("password")

url = "https://oidc.provider:443/as/token.oauth2"
data = parse.urlencode( {
    "grant_type": "password",
    "username": user,
    "password": pwd,
    "scope": "openid",
    "client_id": "testclient"
} ).encode()
req = request.Request(url=url, data=data)
req.add_header("Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded")
with request.urlopen(req) as f:
    body = f.read().decode(f.headers.get_content_charset())
    resp = json.loads(body)
    access_token = resp["access_token"]
```

#### Enable ROPC in QuestDB

The Resource Owner Password Credentials flow can be enabled in QuestDB within
`server.conf`:

```
acl.oidc.ropc.flow.enabled = true
```

Now we can use Basic Authentication to simplify our code. We send the
credentials to QuestDB, and the database will validate the credentials against
the OAuth2 provider.

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
from urllib import request
import base64

load_dotenv()
user = os.environ.get("username")
pwd = os.environ.get("password")

query = parse.urlencode({
    "query": "select current_user()"
})
req = request.Request(f"http://localhost:9000/exec?{query}")
b64credentials = base64.standard_b64encode(f"{user}:{pwd}".encode()).decode()
req.add_header("Authorization", f"Basic {b64credentials}")
with request.urlopen(req) as f:
    body = f.read().decode(f.headers.get_content_charset())
    resp = json.loads(body)
    print(resp)
```

We can also use a postgres client to connect to the database:

:::note

QuestDB never persists the user's credentials.

:::

```python
import psycopg as pg
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()
user = os.environ.get("username")
pwd = os.environ.get("password")

conn_str = f"user={user} password={pwd} host=localhost port=8812 dbname=qdb"
with pg.connect(conn_str, autocommit=True) as connection:
    with connection.cursor() as cur:
        cur.execute("select current_user()")
        records = cur.fetchall()
        for row in records:
            print(row)
```

### CLI, standalone applications

When using CLI tools, such as `psql`, or standalone applications like Microsoft
Access, the best option may be the Resource Owner Password Credentials flow.

The user logs in with their SSO credentials, and the server validates the
details with the OAuth2 provider:

```shell
% psql -h localhost -p 8812 -U testuser
Password for user testuser:
psql (14.2, server 11.3)
Type "help" for help.

testldap=>
testldap=>
```

## Non-interactive clients

Non-interactive clients are usually jobs or standalone applications, such as a
client for ingesting data. It is practical to manage their credentials via an
OAuth2 provider too.

As seen in the Jupyter notebook examples, the clients can request a token
themselves and then use it to authorise data ingestion:

```python
import json
import os
import requests
import pandas as pd
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from questdb.ingress import Sender

load_dotenv()
user = os.environ.get("username")
pwd = os.environ.get("password")

token_endpoint = "https://oidc.provider:443/as/token.oauth2"
response = requests.post(token_endpoint,
                         data={"grant_type": "password",
                               "client_id": "testclient",
                               "username": user,
                               "password": pwd,
                               "scope": "openid"},
                         headers={"Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"})

response_body = response.content.decode("utf-8")
tokens = json.loads(response_body)
access_token = tokens["access_token"]

conf = f"http::addr=localhost:9000;token={access_token};"
with Sender.from_conf(conf) as sender:
    df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
    df["ts"] = pd.to_datetime(df["ts"])
    sender.dataframe(df, table_name="foo", at="ts")
```

Alternatively, a user may rely on QuestDB to authenticate them via the OAuth2
provider when the Resource Owner Password Credentials flow is enabled on the
server side:

```python
import os
import pandas as pd
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from questdb.ingress import Sender

load_dotenv()
user = os.environ.get("username")
pwd = os.environ.get("password")

conf = f"http::addr=localhost:9000;username={user};password={pwd};"
with Sender.from_conf(conf) as sender:
    df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
    df["ts"] = pd.to_datetime(df["ts"])
    sender.dataframe(df, table_name="foo", at="ts")
```

## User permissions

QuestDB requires additional user information to be able to construct the user's
access list.

As a reminder, the access list is the list of permissions that determines what
the user can and cannot do.

QuestDB itself does not store external users, nor their passwords or any other
authentication related detail.

External users and their authentication methods are managed by the Identity
Provider.

Since external users are not managed by QuestDB, permissions cannot be granted
to them directly.

Instead, the database expects a list of groups, called the _groups claim_ to be
present in the user information.

These external group names are mapped to QuestDB's own groups.

The access list of the external user consists of the permissions granted to
those groups:

<Screenshot
  alt="OpenID setup"
  src="/img/docs/guide/oidc/oidc-setup-3.webp"
  title="User permissions"
  width={550}
/>

### Mapping user permissions

The mappings between external and QuestDB groups are managed with the following
SQL commands:

```questdb-sql title="Create a group which is mapped to an Active Directory group"
CREATE GROUP groupName WITH EXTERNAL ALIAS 'CN=TestGroup1,OU=DC Users,DC=ad,DC=quest,DC=dev';
```

```questdb-sql title="Map an Active Directory group to an already existing QuestDB group"
ALTER GROUP groupName WITH EXTERNAL ALIAS 'CN=TestGroup1,OU=DC Users,DC=ad,DC=quest,DC=dev';
```

```questdb-sql title="Remove an Active Directory mapping without deleting the QuestDB group"
ALTER GROUP groupName DROP EXTERNAL ALIAS 'CN=TestGroup1,OU=DC Users,DC=ad,DC=quest,DC=dev';
```

QuestDB works the list of external groups out from the User Info response
message.

If we take the example used earlier, we will see that the message contains a
claim called `groups`. This name is configurable in QuestDB.

If the groups claim is missing or it is an empty list, the user cannot access
the database.

Although the user is authenticated, they have no permissions at all.

The user has to have at least the `HTTP` permission to be able to successfully
login via the [Web Console](/docs/web-console/).

```json title="User info response example with Active Directory groups"
{
  "sub": "externalUser",
  "name": "External User",
  "groups": [
    "CN=TestGroup1,OU=DC Users,DC=ad,DC=quest,DC=dev",
    "CN=TestGroup2,OU=DC Users,DC=ad,DC=quest,DC=dev"
  ]
}
```

Any change made to the user's group membership in the Identity Provider, QuestDB
will adjust the user's access list.

:::note

There may be a slight delay due to the User Info Cache.

QuestDB will use the cached information until it becomes stale, and gets
updated.

:::

The same stands for changes made to the user's status within the Identity
Provider.

For example, a disabled user will not be kicked out of QuestDB immediately.

The `acl.oidc.cache.ttl` config option drives how often user information should
be synchronized with the Identity Providers.

It should be set accordingly to your organization's policies.

Other parts of the user information, such as the `sub` and the `name` also used
by QuestDB.

They could be displayed in the [Web Console](/docs/web-console/), or appear in
the logs, for example.

## Configuration options

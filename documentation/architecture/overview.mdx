QuestDB offers high-speed ingestion and low-latency analytics on time-series
data. It stores data in a three-tier architecture (streaming WAL files, local
binary storage, and local or remote storage in Parquet format) to improve
interoperability and avoid vendor lock-in.

This document explains QuestDB's internal architecture.

## Key components

QuestDB is comprised of several key components:

- **[Storage engine](/docs/architecture/storage-engine):** Uses a
  column-oriented design to ensure high I/O performance and low latency.

- **[Memory management and native integration](/docs/architecture/memory-management):**
  The system leverages both memory mapping and explicit memory management
  techniques, integrating native code for performance-critical tasks.

- **[Query engine](/docs/architecture/query-engine):** A custom SQL
  parser, a just-in-time (JIT) compiler, and a vectorized execution engine
  process data in table page frames for better CPU use.

- **[Time-series optimizations](/docs/architecture/time-series-optimizations):**
  QuestDB is specifically designed for time-series, and it provides several
  optimizations, such as a designated timestamp, sequential reads, materialized
  views, and in-memory processing.

- **[Replication](/docs/high-availability/overview/):** QuestDB Enterprise supports
  high availability with read replicas and multi-primary configurations.
  See [High Availability](/docs/high-availability/overview/) for details.

- **[Observability](/docs/architecture/observability):** QuestDB exposes
  real-time metrics, health checks, and structured logs to monitor performance
  and streamline diagnostics.

- **[Web console](/docs/getting-started/web-console/overview/):** The engine includes
  a web console for running SQL statements, bulk loading CSV files, and
  displaying monitoring dashboards. QuestDB Enterprise supports single sign-on
  (SSO) in the web console.

## Design patterns & best practices throughout the codebase

- **Immutable data structures:** The system favors immutability to avoid
  concurrency issues and simplify state management.

- **Modular architecture:** Each component (eg., storage, query processing,
  ingestion, etc.) has well-defined interfaces that enhance maintainability and
  decouple functionality.

- **Factory & builder patterns:** These patterns are used to centralize
  construction logic for complex objects such as SQL execution plans and storage
  buffers.

- **Lazy initialization:** Resource-intensive components initialize only when
  needed to reduce startup overhead.

- **Rigorous testing & benchmarks:**
  [Unit tests, integration tests](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/tree/master/core/src/test),
  and performance benchmarks ensure that new enhancements do not compromise
  reliability or performance.

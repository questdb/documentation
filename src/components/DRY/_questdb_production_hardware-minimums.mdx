#### CPU/RAM

A production instance for QuestDB should be provisioned with at least `4 vCPUs` and `8 GiB` of memory. If possible,
a 1:4 `vCPU/RAM` ratio should be used. Some use cases may benefit from a `1:8` ratio, if this means that all the working
set data will fit into memory; this can increase query performance by as much as `10x`.

It is **not recommended** to run production workloads on less than `4 vCPUs`, as below this number, parallel querying optimisations
may be disabled. This is to ensure there is sufficient resources available for ingestion.

#### Architecture

QuestDB should be deployed on Intel/AMD architectures i.e. `x86_64` and **not** on `ARM` i.e. `aarch64`. Some optimisations are not available
on `ARM`, e.g. `SIMD`.

#### Storage

Data should be stored on a data disk with at minimum 3000 IOPS/125 MBps, and ideally at least 5000 IOPS/300 MBps.
Higher end workloads should scale up the disks appropriately, or use multiple disks if necessary.

It is also worth checking the burst capacity of your storage. This capacity should only be used during
heavy I/O spikes/infrequent out-of-order (O3) writes. It is useful to have in case you hit unexpected load bursts.

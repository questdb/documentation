## Syntax

![Flow chart showing the syntax of the DROP SERVICE ACCOUNT keyword](/images/docs/diagrams/dropServiceAccount.svg)

## Description

`DROP SERVICE ACCOUNT` removes an existing service account and all related links
to users or groups.

Unless the `IF EXISTS` clause is applied, an error is raised and the command
fails if the service account does not exist.

## Examples

```questdb-sql
DROP SERVICE ACCOUNT audit;

DROP SERVICE ACCOUNT IF EXISTS audit;
```

It can be verified with:

```questdb-sql
SHOW SERVICE ACCOUNTS;
```

that does not include `audit` in its result.

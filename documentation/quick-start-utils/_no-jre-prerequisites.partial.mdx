This package does not embed Java.

Use this if there is no package for your platform, such as ARM Linux.

Requires local Java 17.

To check your installed version:

```shell
java -version
```

If you do not have Java, install one of the following:

- AdoptOpenJDK
- Amazon Corretto
- OpenJDK
- Oracle Java

Other Java distributions might work but are not tested regularly. For example, it is known that Azul Zing 17 is incompatible.

For environment variable, point `JAVA_HOME` to your Java 17 installation folder.

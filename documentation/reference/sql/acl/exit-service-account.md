`EXIT SERVICE ACCOUNT` - switches current user back from service account,
basically replacing its current access list (belonging to a user account) with
the user's access list.

For full documentation of the Access Control List and Role-based Access Control,
see the [RBAC operations](/docs/operations/rbac) page.

:::note

Role-based Access Control (RBAC) operations are only available in QuestDB
Enterprise.

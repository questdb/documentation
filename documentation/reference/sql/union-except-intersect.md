## Overview

`UNION`, `EXCEPT`, and `INTERSECT` perform set operations.

`UNION` is used to combine the results of two or more queries.

`EXCEPT` and `INTERSECT` return distinct rows by comparing the results of two
queries.

To work properly, all of the following must be true:

- Each query statement should return the same number of column.
- Each column to be combined should have data types that are either the same, or
  supported by `implicit cast`. For example, IPv4 columns can be combined with VARCHAR/STRING
  columns as they will be automatically cast. See [CAST](/docs/reference/sql/cast/) for more
  information.
  - Example:
    ```questdb-sql
    select '1'::varchar as col from long_sequence(1)
    union all
    select '127.0.0.1'::ipv4 from long_sequence(1);
    ```

- Columns in each query statement should be in the same order.

## Syntax

### UNION

![Flow chart showing the syntax of the UNION, EXCEPT & INTERSECT keyword](/images/docs/diagrams/unionExceptIntersect.svg)

- `UNION` returns distinct results.
- `UNION ALL` returns all `UNION` results including duplicates.
- `EXCEPT` returns distinct rows from the left input query that are not returned
  by the right input query.
- `EXCEPT ALL` returns all `EXCEPT` results including duplicates.
- `INTERSECT` returns distinct rows that are returned by both input queries.
- `INTERSECT ALL` returns all `INTERSECT` results including duplicates.

## Examples

The examples for the set operations use the following tables:

sensor_1:

| ID  | make              | city          |
| --- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| 1   | Honeywell         | New York      |
| 2   | United Automation | Miami         |
| 3   | Omron             | Miami         |
| 4   | Honeywell         | San Francisco |
| 5   | Omron             | Boston        |
| 6   | RS Pro            | Boston        |
| 1   | Honeywell         | New York      |

Notice that the last row in the sensor_1 table is a duplicate.

sensor_2:

| ID  | make              | city          |
| --- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| 1   | Honeywell         | San Francisco |
| 2   | United Automation | Boston        |
| 3   | Eberle            | New York      |
| 4   | Honeywell         | Boston        |
| 5   | Omron             | Boston        |
| 6   | RS Pro            | Boston        |

### UNION

```questdb-sql
sensor_1 UNION sensor_2;
```

returns

| ID  | make              | city          |
| --- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| 1   | Honeywell         | New York      |
| 2   | United Automation | Miami         |
| 3   | Omron             | Miami         |
| 4   | Honeywell         | San Francisco |
| 5   | Omron             | Boston        |
| 6   | RS Pro            | Boston        |
| 1   | Honeywell         | San Francisco |
| 2   | United Automation | Boston        |
| 3   | Eberle            | New York      |
| 4   | Honeywell         | Boston        |

`UNION` eliminates duplication even when one of the queries returns nothing.

For instance:

```questdb-sql
sensor_1
UNION
sensor_2 WHERE ID > 10;
```

returns:

| ID  | make              | city          |
| --- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| 1   | Honeywell         | New York      |
| 2   | United Automation | Miami         |
| 3   | Omron             | Miami         |
| 4   | Honeywell         | San Francisco |
| 5   | Omron             | Boston        |
| 6   | RS Pro            | Boston        |

The duplicate row in `sensor_1` is not returned as a result.

```questdb-sql
sensor_1 UNION ALL sensor_2;
```

returns

| ID  | make              | city          |
| --- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| 1   | Honeywell         | New York      |
| 2   | United Automation | Miami         |
| 3   | Omron             | Miami         |
| 4   | Honeywell         | San Francisco |
| 5   | Omron             | Boston        |
| 6   | RS Pro            | Boston        |
| 1   | Honeywell         | San Francisco |
| 2   | United Automation | Boston        |
| 3   | Eberle            | New York      |
| 4   | Honeywell         | Boston        |
| 5   | Omron             | Boston        |
| 6   | RS Pro            | Boston        |

### EXCEPT

```questdb-sql
sensor_1 EXCEPT sensor_2;
```

returns

| ID  | make              | city          |
| --- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| 1   | Honeywell         | New York      |
| 2   | United Automation | Miami         |
| 3   | Omron             | Miami         |
| 4   | Honeywell         | San Francisco |

Notice that `EXCEPT` eliminates duplicates. Let's run `EXCEPT ALL` to change
that.

```questdb-sql
sensor_1 EXCEPT ALL sensor_2;
```

| ID  | make              | city          |
| --- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| 1   | Honeywell         | New York      |
| 2   | United Automation | Miami         |
| 3   | Omron             | Miami         |
| 4   | Honeywell         | San Francisco |
| 1   | Honeywell         | New York      |

### INTERSECT

```questdb-sql
sensor_1 INTERSECT sensor_2;
```

returns

| ID  | make   | city   |
| --- | ------ | ------ |
| 5   | Omron  | Boston |
| 6   | RS Pro | Boston |

In this example we have no duplicates, but if there were any, we could use
`INTERSECT ALL` to have them.

## Keyword execution priority

The QuestDB's engine processes the keywords from left to right, unless the
priority is defined by parenthesis.

For example:

```questdb-sql
query_1 UNION query_2 EXCEPT query_3;
```

is executed as:

```questdb-sql
(query_1 UNION query_2) EXCEPT query_3;
```

Similarly, the following syntax:

```questdb-sql
query_1 UNION query_2 INTERSECT query_3;
```

is executed as:

```questdb-sql
(query_1 UNION query_2) INTERSECT query_3;
```

## Clauses

The set operations can be used with clauses such as `LIMIT`, `ORDER BY`, and
`WHERE`. However, when the clause keywords are added after the set operations,
the execution order for different clauses varies.

For `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY`, the clauses are applied after the set operations.

For example:

```questdb-sql
query_1 UNION query_2
LIMIT 3;
```

is executed as:

```questdb-sql
(query_1 UNION query_2)
LIMIT 3;
```

For `WHERE`, the clause is applied first to the query immediate prior to it.

```questdb-sql
query_1 UNION query_2
WHERE value = 1;
```

is executed as:

```questdb-sql
query_1 UNION (query_2 WHERE value = 1);
```

:::note

- QuestDB applies `GROUP BY` implicitly. See
  [GROUP BY reference](/docs/reference/sql/group-by/) for more information.
- Quest does not support the clause `HAVING` yet.

:::

## Alias

When different aliases are used with set operations, the execution follows a
left-right order and the output uses the first alias.

For example:

```questdb-sql
SELECT alias_1 FROM table_1
UNION
SELECT alias_2 FROM table_2;
```

The output shows `alias_1`.

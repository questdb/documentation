  Configuration knobs for QuestDB native clients (QWP over WebSocket).
  Drives ingress, egress, multi-host failover, and store-and-forward.
---

The QuestDB native client is configured with a single connect string. The
same string format drives QWP ingress, QWP egress, multi-host failover, and
the store-and-forward substrate. Per-language clients accept the same
options under the same names, so configuration is portable across
implementations.

For legacy InfluxDB Line Protocol (ILP) transports (`http`, `https`, `tcp`,
`tcps`), see the [ILP overview](/docs/connect/compatibility/ilp/overview/).

## Syntax {#syntax}

A connect string has the form:

```
schema::key1=value1;key2=value2;
```

The `schema` selects the wire protocol and transport. The remaining
`key=value` pairs configure it. The trailing semicolon is optional but
recommended.

For example:

```
http::addr=localhost:9000;username=admin;password=secret;
```

This selects the HTTP transport, connects to `localhost:9000`, and provides
basic-auth credentials.

For the list of supported schemas, see
[Protocols and transports](#protocols-and-transports).

### Grammar

- **Schema** — alphanumeric ASCII characters and underscore. Terminated by
  `::`.
- **Key** — alphanumeric ASCII characters and underscore. Terminated by `=`.
  Keys are case-sensitive; the canonical form is lowercase `snake_case`.
- **Value** — any character except control characters
  (U+0000–U+001F, U+007F–U+009F). Terminated by `;`.
- **Escaping** — to include a literal `;` in a value, double it (`;;`).

Example with an escaped semicolon in a password (the actual password value
is `p;ssw;rd`):

```
http::addr=localhost:9000;username=admin;password=p;;ssw;;rd;
```

### Loading a connect string

The Java client accepts a connect string in three ways:

- From a string literal:

  ```java
  Sender sender = Sender.fromConfig("http::addr=localhost:9000;");
  ```

- From an environment variable (reads `QDB_CLIENT_CONF`):

  ```java
  Sender sender = Sender.fromEnv();
  ```

- From the builder, which accepts the same option keys programmatically:

  ```java
  Sender sender = Sender.builder(Transport.HTTP)
      .address("localhost:9000")
      .build();
  ```

Other language clients expose equivalent entry points; see each
[client library page](/docs/connect/overview/#client-libraries) for the
per-language syntax.

## Common patterns {#common-patterns}

Canonical shapes for typical deployments. Each can be extended with
auth, failover, or store-and-forward options from the sections below.

### Local development (no auth, no TLS)

```
ws::addr=localhost:9000;
```

### Production with basic auth (TLS)

```
wss::addr=questdb.example.com:443;username=admin;password=secret;
```

### Production with a custom trust store

```
wss::addr=questdb.example.com:443;username=admin;password=secret;tls_roots=/etc/ssl/truststore.jks;tls_roots_password=changeit;
```

### Ingest with store-and-forward across multiple nodes

```
ws::addr=node-a:9000,node-b:9000;sf_dir=/var/lib/myapp/qdb-sf;sender_id=ingest-1;
```

### Query (egress) preferring a replica in your zone

```
wss::addr=node-a:443,node-b:443;target=replica;zone=eu-west-1a;
```

## Protocols and transports {#protocols-and-transports}

*Applies to: ingress and egress.*

The schema prefix selects the QWP transport.

| Schema | Transport       | Default port | Notes                                                                                                                |
| ------ | --------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ws`   | WebSocket       | `9000`       | QWP over plain WebSocket. Use for development or trusted networks.                                                   |
| `wss`  | WebSocket + TLS | `9000`       | QWP over TLS-secured WebSocket. Recommended for production.                                                          |
| `udp`  | UDP             | `9007`       | Fire-and-forget metrics ingest, single table per datagram. |

The default port is applied when `addr` omits `:port`. Note that `wss` does
**not** default to `443`: both `ws` and `wss` use `9000` unless overridden.

QWP negotiates its protocol version during the WebSocket upgrade — clients
do not need to configure it.

## Authentication {#auth}

*Applies to: ingress and egress.*

QWP runs over WebSocket and uses HTTP-style credentials sent on the
WebSocket upgrade request.

- `username` — username for HTTP basic authentication.
- `password` — password for HTTP basic authentication.
- `token` — bearer token sent as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Mutually
  exclusive with `username` / `password`. For OIDC-issued tokens, see
  [OIDC](#oidc).
- `auth_timeout_ms` — per-host upper bound on the upgrade response read.
  Does not cover TCP connect, TLS handshake, or post-upgrade frame reads —
  those use OS or hard-coded defaults. Default: `15000` (15 s).

**Mutual TLS (mTLS).** Not supported. The client validates the server's
certificate against a trust store but cannot present a client certificate;
the TLS handshake is server-authenticated only. `tls_roots` /
`tls_roots_password` configure server-cert trust, not client identity. Use
`token=<access_token>` (bearer / OIDC) or `username=` / `password=` for
client authentication.

### OIDC {#oidc}

The client does not perform OIDC flows itself: no issuer discovery, no
client registration, and no token refresh. To authenticate against a
QuestDB Enterprise server configured with an OIDC provider, obtain an
access token out-of-band and pass it as `token=<access_token>`; the server
validates the token against its configured OIDC provider and resolves the
principal and groups from the token claims.

```
wss::addr=questdb.example.com:443;token=<access_token>;
```

The token is static for the lifetime of the connection. The application
is responsible for refreshing the token and creating a new client (or
reconnecting with an updated connect string) before expiry. `oidc_*`
connect-string keys are not supported.

## TLS {#tls}

*Applies to: ingress and egress.*

TLS is enabled by selecting the `wss` schema.

- `tls_verify` — controls server certificate verification. Options: `on`,
  `unsafe_off`. Default: `on`. `unsafe_off` disables verification; **use
  only for testing** — bypassing verification makes the connection
  vulnerable to MITM attacks.
- `tls_roots` — path to a Java keystore (`.jks`) containing trusted root
  certificates. If omitted, the system default trust store is used.
- `tls_roots_password` — password for the keystore file. Required when
  `tls_roots` is set.

:::note Client support varies

`tls_roots` / `tls_roots_password` are a Java-keystore feature. Some clients
(for example, Go) verify against the operating-system trust store only and
**reject these keys at parse time**; to trust a private CA there, install it
in the host trust store. Check the relevant
[client library page](/docs/connect/overview/#client-libraries) for
specifics.

Mutual TLS (client certificates) is not supported by QuestDB — the server
does not negotiate client certificates regardless of client. See
[Authentication](#auth) for the supported credential paths.

:::

See also the [server-side TLS configuration](/docs/security/tls/).

## Auto-flushing {#auto-flush}

*Applies to: ingress.*

The client buffers rows in memory and flushes them to the server in batches.
Auto-flushing controls when the buffer is sent without an explicit
`flush()` call.

- `auto_flush` — global enable. Options: `on`, `off`. Default: `on`.
  When `off`, the application must call `flush()` explicitly to send
  buffered rows.
- `auto_flush_rows` — flush when the buffered row count reaches this
  threshold. Set to `off` to disable. Default: `1000`.
- `auto_flush_interval` — flush when this many milliseconds have elapsed
  since the first buffered row. Evaluated on the next `at()` / `flush()`
  call (not driven by a wall-clock timer). Set to `off` to disable.
  Default: `100` (100 ms).
- `auto_flush_bytes` — flush when the encode buffer reaches this byte
  size. Set to `off` to disable. Default: `0` (off). Accepts
  [size suffixes](#size-suffixes).

## Buffer sizing {#buffer}

*Applies to: ingress (encode buffer). `max_schemas_per_connection` also
applies to egress.*

These keys control the in-memory row buffer that the client uses before
flushing.

- `init_buf_size` — initial buffer size in bytes. Default: `65536`
  (64 KiB). Accepts [size suffixes](#size-suffixes).
- `max_buf_size` — maximum buffer size; the buffer grows up to this cap.
  Default: `104857600` (100 MiB). Accepts size suffixes.
- `max_name_len` — maximum allowed length of a table or column name in
  bytes. Default: `127`.
- `max_schemas_per_connection` — per-connection ceiling on the number of
  distinct schema IDs the client can register. WebSocket / QWP only.
  Default: `65535`.
- `max_datagram_size` — UDP only. Maximum datagram size; defaults to a
  value below typical Ethernet MTU.

### Size suffixes {#size-suffixes}

Size-typed values (`init_buf_size`, `max_buf_size`, `sf_max_bytes`,
`sf_max_total_bytes`) accept JVM-style unit suffixes. Suffixes are
case-insensitive and 1024-based, matching `-Xmx` conventions:

| Suffix         | Meaning           | Example      |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| *(none)*       | bytes             | `65536`      |
| `k` or `kb`    | KiB (× 1024)      | `64k`        |
| `m` or `mb`    | MiB (× 1024²)     | `4m`, `4mb`  |
| `g` or `gb`    | GiB (× 1024³)     | `1g`, `10gb` |
| `t` or `tb`    | TiB (× 1024⁴)     | `1t`         |

## Multi-host failover {#failover-keys}

*Applies to: ingress and egress. The [Role filter and zone preference](#role-filter-and-zone-preference)
sub-section is egress only.*

:::note QuestDB Enterprise

Multi-host failover requires QuestDB Enterprise. OSS is single-node — there
is no secondary server to fail over to.

:::

The connect string accepts multiple `host:port` pairs in `addr`. Two
syntaxes are accepted and accumulate:

```
ws::addr=node-a:9000,node-b:9000,node-c:9000;
```

```
ws::addr=node-a:9000;addr=node-b:9000;addr=node-c:9000;
```

Empty entries (`,,`, or leading / trailing commas) are rejected.

The I/O loop rotates through the endpoints on every reconnect attempt
within a single outage budget. When the server rejects the connection
because the current host is in the wrong role, the client treats it as
failover input and immediately tries the next endpoint without waiting for
backoff.

### Role filter and zone preference

Both `target` and `zone` apply to **egress only**. QuestDB is currently a
single-primary cluster: ingress automatically follows the primary across
the host list and adapts when the primary moves to another node. These
keys are silently accepted on ingress but have no effect.

- `target` — server-role filter applied per endpoint after the upgrade
  reads `SERVER_INFO`. Options:
  - `any` (default) — no preference; route to any healthy endpoint.
  - `primary` — route only to the writer. Use when queries must see the
    most recent data; replicas are eventually consistent and may lag the
    primary.
  - `replica` — route only to replicas. Use for historical or analytical
    queries to avoid contending with the ingest traffic the primary is
    handling.

  Endpoints whose role does not match the filter are skipped.

- `zone` — client zone identifier (opaque, case-insensitive — e.g.
  `eu-west-1a`, `dc-amsterdam`). When set, egress prefers endpoints whose
  server-advertised `zone_id` matches the client's. Mismatched-zone
  endpoints — typically a remote DR replica — drop to a lower priority
  tier; the client routes to them only as a last resort, when every
  same-zone endpoint is unhealthy. With `target=primary`, zone preference
  collapses: the writer is followed regardless of zone.

The full behavioural model — host picker policy, host-health states, error
classification, and backoff schedule — is documented under the Connect
section (Client failover, coming with Bundle C). Server-side HA is covered
separately under the
[High Availability section](/docs/high-availability/overview/).

Related: [Reconnect and failover](#reconnect-keys),
[Store-and-forward](#sf-keys).

:::warning Enable DEDUP on tables ingested through failover

On unplanned failover — when the primary dies before issuing a durable
ACK — the client replays unacknowledged frames against the new primary.
Without [DEDUP](/docs/concepts/deduplication/) on the target table, those
replays can produce duplicate rows. Tables ingested through a multi-host
failover connect string **must** declare `DEDUP UPSERT KEYS(...)` covering
row identity. See [Delivery semantics](/docs/concepts/delivery-semantics/)
for the full at-least-once / exactly-once model.

:::

## Store-and-forward {#sf-keys}

*Applies to: ingress.*

Store-and-forward (SF) is an opt-in durability substrate available on QWP /
WebSocket. The client persists outgoing frames to disk before sending; the
server's cumulative ACK trims acknowledged segments. If the connection drops
or the client process restarts, the I/O thread silently reconnects and
replays whatever is still on disk.

To enable SF mode, set `sf_dir`. Without it, the client runs a memory-only
equivalent — same architecture, no durability across restarts.

### Storage

- `sf_dir` — parent directory under which the slot lives. The slot path is
  `<sf_dir>/<sender_id>/`. Required for SF mode; omit for memory-only mode.
  Path handling:
  - Taken verbatim. Absolute paths recommended for production; relative
    paths resolve against the process working directory.
  - Shell-style expansions like `~` are **not** expanded by the client.
  - The leaf directory is created automatically if missing, but its parent
    must already exist — the client does not create paths recursively.
- `sender_id` — slot identity. The slot lives at `<sf_dir>/<sender_id>/`,
  used verbatim as the directory name. Allowed characters: letters,
  digits, `_`, `-`. No path separators, no `.`, no spaces. Two senders
  sharing the same `sender_id` collide on the slot lock — the second one
  fails fast. Default: `default`.
- `sf_durability` — disk durability mode. Currently only `memory` is
  shipping. (`flush` and `append` per-write fsync modes are planned.)
- `sf_max_bytes` — per-segment rotation threshold. Must be ≥ the largest
  single flushed frame. Default: `4 MiB` (`4m`). Accepts
  [size suffixes](#size-suffixes).
- `sf_max_total_bytes` — hard cap on per-slot storage. When the cap is
  reached, append blocks until ACKs trim space (see
  `sf_append_deadline_millis`). Defaults: `10 GiB` (`10g`) in SF mode,
  `128 MiB` (`128m`) in memory mode. Accepts size suffixes.

### Sender restart and replay

SF persists outgoing frames and the durable-ack watermark to disk under
`<sf_dir>/<sender_id>/`.

**Recovery is triggered at Sender creation.** When the application
instantiates a new sender — `Sender.fromConfig(...)`, `Sender.fromEnv()`,
or the builder — the client analyses the on-disk state under `sf_dir`
before returning control. There is no background daemon; replay is part
of the Sender lifecycle.

To resume from the previous session's buffer after a restart — clean
exit, SIGKILL, host crash, or reboot — instantiate a new sender with the
**same** `sf_dir` and `sender_id`:

1. The new sender acquires the slot's POSIX `flock` (`LockFileEx` on
   Windows). If the previous process is still alive and holds the lock,
   the new sender fails fast with `sf slot already in use`. The kernel
   releases the lock on process exit, even after SIGKILL, so a crashed
   sender does not leave the slot stuck.
2. Recovery reads the persisted ack watermark and replays every on-disk
   segment past it against the server. Replay runs on the I/O thread in
   parallel with the application's new `append()` calls — the application
   is not blocked.

If `sf_dir` is a relative path, ensure the process resolves it the same
way after restart (typically: use an absolute path).

For an **abandoned** slot to be picked up by a *different* sender — the
original is never coming back — see [Orphan recovery](#orphan-recovery)
below.

**At-least-once delivery.** Replay can re-send frames the server already
accepted but did not durable-acknowledge before the previous sender died.
To prevent duplicate rows in the target table, declare
[DEDUP](/docs/concepts/deduplication/) `UPSERT KEYS(...)` covering row
identity. See [Delivery semantics](/docs/concepts/delivery-semantics/) for
the full model and recipe.

### Backpressure

- `sf_append_deadline_millis` — maximum time `append()` waits for trim to
  free space when the cap is hit. If the deadline fires, the call throws.
  Default: `30000` (30 s).

### Orphan recovery

When `drain_orphans=on`, the new sender scans `<sf_dir>/*` at startup for
sibling slots that are unlocked and contain unacked data. The scan runs
as part of Sender creation (alongside the same-slot recovery above). Each
orphan slot is locked, drained on its own dedicated connection, and
released — **multiple orphans drain in parallel**, up to
`max_background_drainers` concurrent drains.

- `drain_orphans` — `on` enables the orphan drainer pool. Default: `off`.
- `max_background_drainers` — maximum concurrent drainers. Default: `4`.

For delivery semantics, architecture, and tradeoffs (at-least-once
guarantees, DEDUP requirements, segment-granular trim), see the
Store-and-forward concepts page under Connect (coming with Bundle C).

## Reconnect and failover {#reconnect-keys}

*Applies to: ingress and egress (separate key families).*

QWP / WebSocket has two distinct recovery loops, each with its own knob
family. The **ingress** cursor-engine reconnect loop runs continuously for
the lifetime of the sender. The **egress** per-`Execute()` failover loop
runs once per query.

### Ingress reconnect

These keys control the cursor-engine reconnect loop used by QWP ingest.
SF mode and memory-only mode share the same loop.

- `reconnect_initial_backoff_millis` — initial wait between reconnect
  attempts. Backoff grows exponentially up to `reconnect_max_backoff_millis`.
  Default: `100`.
- `reconnect_max_backoff_millis` — cap on per-attempt backoff. (Alias:
  `max_backoff_millis`.) Default: `5000` (5 s).
- `reconnect_max_duration_millis` — total time budget for a single outage.
  Once exceeded, the I/O loop gives up and surfaces a terminal error.
  Default: `300000` (5 min).
- `initial_connect_retry` — whether the initial connect attempt is retried
  on failure. The same loop drives the retry.
  - `off` (default, alias `false`) — fail fast on initial connect failure.
  - `on` (aliases `sync`, `true`) — retry synchronously on the user
    thread.
  - `async` — return the `Sender` immediately; the I/O thread retries in
    the background, surfacing terminal failures via the error inbox.
- `close_flush_timeout_millis` — `close()` blocks up to this many
  milliseconds waiting for buffered frames to drain. Default: `5000` (5 s).
  Set to `0` or `-1` for fast close (skip the drain).

Auth failures during reconnect (authentication rejected, version mismatch,
durable-ack mismatch, non-101 upgrade without a role hint) are immediately
terminal — the loop does not retry them.

### Egress failover {#egress-failover}

These keys control the per-`Execute()` reconnect loop on the QWP query
client. Each query has its own budget; the loop resets between queries.
Requires QuestDB Enterprise (multi-host).

- `failover` — master switch. `on` (default) or `off`. When `off`,
  transport errors surface directly through `onError` without retry.
- `failover_max_attempts` — cap on reconnects per `Execute()` (initial
  attempt + `N − 1` failovers). Default: `8`.
- `failover_backoff_initial_ms` — first post-failure sleep. Default: `50`.
- `failover_backoff_max_ms` — cap on per-attempt sleep. Default: `1000`
  (1 s).
- `failover_max_duration_ms` — total wall-clock budget per `Execute()`.
  Default: `30000` (30 s). Set to `0` for unbounded.

## Durable ACK {#durable-ack}

*Applies to: ingress.*

:::note QuestDB Enterprise

Durable ACK requires QuestDB Enterprise. OSS is single-node and does not
ship WALs off-box, so the server-side durability-acknowledgement signal
that drives this protocol is enterprise-only.

:::

QuestDB Enterprise ships Write-Ahead Logs (WALs) from the primary to an
object store or another file system — typically over the network. Once a
WAL is durably shipped, the server emits a `STATUS_DURABLE_ACK` frame to
the store-and-forward client; the client marks that frame's FSN as durable
only after this acknowledgement arrives.

The benefit: if the primary dies before shipping a WAL, the client still
holds the corresponding frames in its SF buffer and replays them against
the new primary on failover — closing the data-loss window that a
transport-level OK ACK alone cannot close.

- `request_durable_ack` — when `on`, the client gates trim on
  `STATUS_DURABLE_ACK` frames from the server, suppressing OK-driven trim.
  Default: `off`.
- `durable_ack_keepalive_interval_millis` — interval at which the client
  emits keepalive PINGs while waiting for durable-ack frames. Required
  because the server only flushes pending durable acks on inbound recv
  events. Default: `200` (ms). Set to `0` or a negative value to disable.

See the [QWP Egress (WebSocket)](/docs/connect/wire-protocols/qwp-egress-websocket/)
wire protocol for the underlying mechanism.

## Query client keys {#egress-keys}

*Applies to: egress (query client).*

These keys are accepted by the QWP query client's connect string (the
egress / `QwpQueryClient` path). They are not sender keys.

- `compression` — result-batch compression the client advertises. Options:
  `raw` (default — no compression, the accept-encoding header is omitted so
  pre-compression servers see an unchanged handshake), `zstd` (demand
  zstd), `auto` (accept zstd if the server offers it).
- `compression_level` — zstd level hint. Range `1`–`22`. Ignored when
  `compression=raw`. Default is the client's library default.
- `initial_credit` — byte-credit flow-control budget. `0` (default) means
  unbounded: the server streams as fast as the network allows. Set a
  non-zero budget to bound server push on a memory-constrained client.
- `max_batch_rows` — upper bound on rows per result batch.
- `buffer_pool_size` — size of the client-side decode buffer pool.

Equivalent options exist on the query client's builder API (for example,
`WithQwpQueryCompression`, `WithQwpQueryCompressionLevel`,
`WithQwpQueryInitialCredit` in the Go client). See the
[client library page](/docs/connect/overview/#client-libraries) for the
per-language names.

## Error handling {#error-handling}

*Applies to: ingress and egress.*

The QWP / WebSocket I/O loop reports errors via an asynchronous inbox
consumed by the application.

- `error_inbox_capacity` — bounded capacity for async error notifications.
  Must be ≥ `16`. Overflow drops the oldest entry and bumps a
  `droppedErrorNotifications` counter. Default: `256`.

The following per-category override keys are **reserved by the spec but
not yet recognised by the Java connect-string parser** — today they are
wired only via the fluent builder API. New client implementations should
accept them in the connect string per the spec; precedence rules are
documented in the [QWP store-and-forward spec](https://github.com/questdb/questdb-enterprise/blob/main/questdb/docs/qwp/sf-client.md)
§14.

- `on_server_error` — handler for server-reject status frames.
- `on_schema_error` — handler for schema-validation errors.
- `on_parse_error` — handler for client-side parse errors.
- `on_internal_error` — handler for unexpected client-side errors.
- `on_security_error` — handler for auth / TLS errors.
- `on_write_error` — handler for transport write failures.

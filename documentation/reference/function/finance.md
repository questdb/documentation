## l2price

Trade price calculation.

`l2price(target_quantity, quantity_1, price_1, quantity_2, price_2, ..., quantity_n, price_n)`

Consider `quantity_1`, `price_1`, `quantity_2`, `price_2`, ..., `quantity_n`,
`price_n` to be either side of an order book with `n` price levels. Then, the
return value of the function is the average trade price of a market order
executed with the size of `target_quantity` against the book.

Let's take the below order book as an example.

| Size | Bid   | Ask   | Size |
| ---- | ----- | ----- | ---- |
| 10   | 14.10 | 14.50 | 14   |
| 17   | 14.00 | 14.60 | 16   |
| 19   | 13.90 | 14.80 | 23   |
| 21   | 13.70 | 15.10 | 12   |
| 18   | 13.40 |       |      |

A _buy market order_ with the size of 50 would wipe out the first two price
levels of the _Ask_ side of the book, and would also trade on the third level.

The full price of the trade:

$$
14 \cdot \$14.50 + 16 \cdot \$14.60 + (50 - 14 - 16) \cdot \$14.80 = \$732.60
$$

The average price of the instrument in this trade:

$$
\$732.60 / 50 = \$14.652
$$

This average trade price is the output of the function when executed with the
parameters taken from the above example:

```questdb-sql
select l2price(50, 14, 14.50, 16, 14.60, 23, 14.80, 12, 15.10);
```

| l2price |
| ------- |
| 14.652  |

### Parameters

The function takes a `target quantity`, and a variable number of
`quantity`/`price` pairs. Each represents a price level of the order book.

Each parameter is expected to be a double, or convertible to double (float,
long, int, short, byte).

- `target_quantity`: The size of a hypothetical market order to be filled.
- `quantity*`: The number of instruments available at the corresponding price
  levels.
- `price*`: Price levels of the order book.

### Return value

The function returns with a `double`, representing the average trade price.

Returns null if the price is not calculable. For example, if the target quantity
cannot be filled, or there is incomplete data in the set (nulls).

### Examples

Test data:

```questdb-sql
CREATE TABLE order_book (
  ts TIMESTAMP,
  bidSize1 DOUBLE, bid1 DOUBLE, bidSize2 DOUBLE, bid2 DOUBLE, bidSize3 DOUBLE, bid3 DOUBLE,
  askSize1 DOUBLE, ask1 DOUBLE, askSize2 DOUBLE, ask2 DOUBLE, askSize3 DOUBLE, ask3 DOUBLE
) TIMESTAMP(ts) PARTITION BY DAY;

## regr_intercept

`regr_intercept(y, x)` - Calculates the y-intercept of the linear regression line for the given numeric columns y (dependent variable) and x (independent variable).

- The function requires at least two valid (y, x) pairs to compute the intercept.
  - If fewer than two pairs are available, the function returns null.
- Supported data types for x and y include `double`, `float`, and `integer` types.
- The `regr_intercept` function can be used with other statistical aggregation functions like `regr_slope` or `corr`.
- The order of arguments in `regr_intercept(y, x)` matters.
  - Ensure that y is the dependent variable and x is the independent variable.

### Calculation

The y-intercept $b_0$ of the regression line $y = b_0 + b_1 x$ is calculated using the formula:

$$
b_0 = \bar{y} - b_1 \bar{x}
$$

Where:
- $\bar{y}$ is the mean of y values
- $\bar{x}$ is the mean of x values
- $b_1$ is the slope calculated by `regr_slope(y, x)`

### Arguments

- y: A numeric column representing the dependent variable.
- x: A numeric column representing the independent variable.

### Return value

Return value type is `double`.

The function returns the y-intercept of the regression line, indicating the predicted value of y when x is 0.

### Examples

#### Calculate the regression intercept between two variables

Using the same measurements table:

| x   | y   |
| --- | --- |
| 1.0 | 2.0 |
| 2.0 | 3.0 |
| 3.0 | 5.0 |
| 4.0 | 4.0 |
| 5.0 | 6.0 |

Calculate the y-intercept:

```questdb-sql
SELECT regr_intercept(y, x) AS y_intercept FROM measurements;
```

Result:

| y_intercept |
| ----------- |
| 1.4         |

Or: When x is 0, y is predicted to be 1.4 units.

#### Calculate the regression intercept grouped by category

Using the same sales_data table:

| category | advertising_spend | sales |
| -------- | ---------------- | ----- |
| A        | 1000             | 15000 |
| A        | 2000             | 22000 |
| A        | 3000             | 28000 |
| B        | 1500             | 18000 |
| B        | 2500             | 26000 |
| B        | 3500             | 31000 |

```questdb-sql
SELECT category, regr_intercept(sales, advertising_spend) AS base_sales
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY category;
```

Result:

| category | base_sales |
| -------- | ---------- |
| A        | 9500       |
| B        | 12000      |

Or:

- In category A, with no advertising spend, the predicted base sales are 9,500 units
- In category B, with no advertising spend, the predicted base sales are 12,000 units

#### Handling null values

The function ignores rows where either x or y is null:

```questdb-sql
SELECT regr_intercept(y, x) AS y_intercept
FROM (
    SELECT 1 AS x, 2 AS y
    UNION ALL SELECT 2, NULL
    UNION ALL SELECT NULL, 4
    UNION ALL SELECT 4, 5
);
```

Result:

| y_intercept |
| ----------- |
| 1.4         |

Only the rows where both x and y are not null are considered in the calculation.

## regr_slope

`regr_slope(y, x)` - Calculates the slope of the linear regression line for the
given numeric columns y (dependent variable) and x (independent variable).

- The function requires at least two valid (x, y) pairs to compute the slope.
  - If fewer than two pairs are available, the function returns null.
- Supported data types for x and y include `double`, `float`, and `integer`
  types.
- The regr_slope function can be used with other statistical aggregation
  functions like `corr` or `covar_samp`.
- The order of arguments in `regr_slope(y, x)` matters.
  - Ensure that y is the dependent variable and x is the independent variable.

### Calculation

The slope $b_1$ of the regression line $y = b_0 + b_1 x$ is calculated using the
formula:

$$
b_1 = \frac{N \sum (xy) - \sum x \sum y}{N \sum (x^2) - (\sum x)^2}
$$

Where:

- $N$ is the number of valid data points.
- $\sum (xy)$ is the sum of the products of $x$ and $y$.
- $\sum x$ and $\sum y$ is the sums of $x$ and $y$ values, respectively.
- $\sum (x^2)$ is the sum of the squares of $x$ values.

### Arguments

- y: A numeric column representing the dependent variable.
- x: A numeric column representing the independent variable.

### Return value

Return value type is `double`.

The function returns the slope of the regression line, indicating how much y
changes for a unit change in x.

### Examples

#### Calculate the regression slope between two variables

Suppose you have a table measurements with the following data:

| x   | y   |
| --- | --- |
| 1.0 | 2.0 |
| 2.0 | 3.0 |
| 3.0 | 5.0 |
| 4.0 | 4.0 |
| 5.0 | 6.0 |

You can calculate the slope of the regression line between y and x using:

```questdb-sql
SELECT regr_slope(y, x) AS slope FROM measurements;
```

Result:

| slope |
| ----- |
| 0.8   |

Or: The slope of 0.8 indicates that for each unit increase in x, y increases by
0.8 units on average.

#### Calculate the regression slope grouped by a category

Consider a table sales_data:

| category | advertising_spend | sales |
| -------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| A        | 1000              | 15000 |
| A        | 2000              | 22000 |
| A        | 3000              | 28000 |
| B        | 1500              | 18000 |
| B        | 2500              | 26000 |
| B        | 3500              | 31000 |

Calculate the regression slope of `sales` versus `advertising_spend` for each
category:

```questdb-sql
SELECT category, regr_slope(sales, advertising_spend) AS slope FROM sales_data
GROUP BY category;
```

Result:

| category | slope |
| -------- | ----- |
| A        | 8.5   |
| B        | 7.0   |

Or:

- In category A, for every additional unit spent on advertising, sales increase
  by 8.5 units on average.
- In category B, the increase is 7.0 units per advertising unit spent.

#### Handling null values

If your data contains null values, `regr_slope()` will ignore those rows:

```questdb
SELECT regr_slope(y, x) AS slope FROM ( SELECT 1 AS x, 2 AS y UNION ALL SELECT
2, NULL UNION ALL SELECT NULL, 4 UNION ALL SELECT 4, 5 );
```

Result:

| slope |
| ----- |
| 0.8   |

Only the rows where both x and y are not null are considered in the calculation.

#### Calculating beta

Assuming you have a table `stock_returns` with daily returns for a specific
stock and the market index:

| date       | stock_return | market_return |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| 2023-01-01 | 0.5          | 0.4           |
| 2023-01-02 | -0.2         | -0.1          |
| 2023-01-03 | 0.3          | 0.2           |
| ...        | ...          | ...           |

Calculate the stock's beta coefficient:

```questdb-sql
SELECT regr_slope(stock_return, market_return) AS beta FROM stock_returns;
```

| beta |
| ---- |
| 1.2  |

Or: A beta of 1.2 suggests the stock is 20% more volatile than the market.

Remember: The order of arguments in `regr_slope(y, x)` matters.

Ensure that y is the dependent variable and x is the independent variable.

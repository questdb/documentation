  Documentation for the REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW SQL keyword in QuestDB.

`REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` refreshes the given materialized view. Helpful in
situations when the view is invalid and no longer refreshes incrementally.

When the FULL keyword is specified, this command deletes the data in the target
materialized view and inserts the results of the query into the view. It also
marks the materialized view as valid, so that it activates the incremental
refresh.

With the `INCREMENTAL` keyword, the `REFRESH` command schedules an incremental
refresh of the materialized view. Usually, incremental refresh is automatic, so
this command is useful only in niche situations when incremental refresh is no
longer happening due to a problem.

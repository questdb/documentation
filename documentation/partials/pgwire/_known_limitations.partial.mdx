## PGWire Known Limitations with QuestDB

- Some PostgreSQL-specific features (complex transaction semantics, exotic data types, certain metadata calls) may not be fully supported.
- Cursors/scrollable result sets and some ORM expectations may behave differently than in PostgreSQL.
- Prefer **querying** via PGWire and **ingestion** via ILP for best throughput.

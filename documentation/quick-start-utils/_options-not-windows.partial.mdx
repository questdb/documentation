| Option | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-d`   | Expects a `dir` directory value which is a folder that will be used as QuestDB's root directory. For more information and the default values, see the [default root](/docs/operations/command-line-options/#default-root-directory-1) section below. |
| `-t`   | Expects a `tag` string value which will be as a tag for the service. This option allows users to run several QuestDB services and manage them separately. If this option is omitted, the default tag will be `questdb`.                              |
| `-f`   | Force re-deploying the [Web Console](/docs/web-console/). Without this option, the [Web Console](/docs/web-console/) is cached and deployed only when missing.                                                                                       |
| `-n`   | Do not respond to the HUP signal. This keeps QuestDB alive after you close the terminal window where you started it.                                                                                                                                 |
